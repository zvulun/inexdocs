Later versions may require changes to this document. This document does not take the place of training by Inex Technologies' certified specialists. Contact Inex Technologies to schedule training. If you have any questions, please contact our support team via our Inex Technologies Website. Prepare components and tools Plan your site Prepare cables Install camera(s) and other components Connect components (wiring) Power up and set up IP Configure camera settings Aim and calibrate Verify system operation Carefully unpack the contents of the camera package. The package includes: IZ600F, Bullet ALPR Camera with 3-axis bracket LAN cable connector (field mountable) 3 mm Allen/hex key for pan/tilt/roll adjustment Screws and anchors to attach the camera to a wall or surface If any parts are missing or damaged, please contact Inex Technologies. Surge protection must be provided on all power, network and data cables All network cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded. Power supply: 12VDC, 1.2 Amp power supply, with male barrel connector (5.5 mm outer diameter, 2.1 mm inner diameter), or PoE (IEEE 802.3af) switch capable of providing 12VDC at 1.2 Amp Figure 1. Male Barrel Connector Waterproof junction box for the camera’s power and LAN connections Waterproof insulating tape (such as butyl tape) for unused camera connections Network cabling (typically CAT 5e/6 cable) and switch. The total length of the cable from the network switch to the camera should not exceed 328 feet (100 meters). A list of accessories that can be supplied by Inex can be found at the end of the specifications table (see your camera’s User Guide and Section 7.1). Pole mount adapter (PMA) - see the Mounting Hardware documentation (see Section 1) External Illuminator - Can be used to enhance overview vehicle image quality, for front and/or rear capture. It is recommended to use an illuminator power supply separate from the camera’s supply. Mount illuminators at an appropriate distance away from their associated camera(s), according to the objectives of your project. Contact Inex for guidance/training about this subject. Position the illuminator so you can aim it at the place where vehicles pass for recognition - while minimizing the glare into drivers' eyes. In most cases, however, white illuminators are mounted to be aimed at the rear of vehicles. Illuminator aiming is most effective at night. You will need to provide a laptop computer to use for configuration. If you will be using the laptop outdoors, the screen must be able to be seen in strong sunlight. Required software: Windows 10 or above - with .NET 4.5 enabled in \"Windows Features\" Chrome or Microsoft Edge browser Network (LAN) cabling (typically CAT 5e/6 cable) with RJ45 connectors. The total length of the cable should not exceed 328 feet (100 meters). See Section 7 for important LAN cable information. Tools for building LAN cables (wire stripper, crimp tool, etc.) and RJ45 connectors. For installations that require network cabling: typically use CAT 5e/6 cable. The total length of the cable should not exceed 328 feet (100 meters). All network cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded. Installations that position the camera at significant angles in relation to the plates will reduce the line-of-sight distances specified. Reflectivity: - Different levels of reflectivity will change the specified distances - By \"Non-reflective\", we mean that the colors have good contrast (black on white, for example), and all colors used in the plate are matte (dull finish). - Other Non-reflective schemes (special colors, for example) may change the specified distances. Contact Inex for advice. You will first need to determine the ambient lighting conditions (illumination) at your site. The lighting conditions may require you to use an external illuminator (see Section 6.5). You may only be able to determine this during camera configuration. Determine the plate types you will be recognizing: reflective, non-reflective or IR (infrared-type)-phobic. Note that both reflective and non-reflective plates can be IR-phobic, as shown in these examples: Reflective IR-phobic plates use character ink that is transparent to IR light. The IR images of these characters are filled with a color very close to that of the plate’s background. This makes it more difficult for an ALPR algorithm to recognize the characters. Figure 2. Reflective IR-phobic Plate Example Non-reflective IR-phobic plates typically have a combination of red and white characters/background, which reduces the contrast between the characters and the background. This makes it more difficult for an ALPR algorithm to recognize the characters: Figure 3. Non-Reflective IR-phobic Plate Examples Install the camera as described in the following sections. Depending upon whether or not the illumination is sufficient at night, and the plate types you need to recognize, you may need to perform the camera calibration and configuration first under dark conditions, and then light (day) conditions. Your camera’s Field of View (FOV) is the area that the camera can \"see\". You can think of this area as an imaginary rectangle rising from the lane upwards. The width of this area is called the horizontal FOV or \"capture line\". See your camera’s User Guide for the horizontal and vertical FOV specifications. Figure 4. Field of View (Capture Line) Select your camera’s position so that license plates are always within the capture line and parallel to it, with the camera facing as straight at the plates as possible - as shown in the following diagrams: Figure 5. Plates Within Capture Line Figure 6. Plates Parallel to Capture Line - Away from Road Curves The maximum horizontal angle allowed is 30° (to the farthest point at the end of the capture line). The maximum vertical angle allowed is 30°. Installations that position the camera at significant angles in relation to the plates will reduce the line-of-sight distances specified. Figure 7. Horizontal Camera Angle (Pan Angle) Click to show notes for Horizontal Angle The maximum horizontal angle allowed is 30° (to the farthest point at the end of the capture line). If you must capture plates on a curve, place the camera on the side of the road that minimizes the horizontal angle. At larger angles, the reflectivity of the plates is reduced, resulting in images with less contrast. For plates whose characters are very shiny (for example, silvery), the weighted angle must be less than 20 degrees. The weighted angle is the angle between a line from the camera to the plate, and a line running straight ahead from the vehicle. Figure 8. Vertical Camera Angle (Tilt Angle) and Line-of-Sight Distance from Plate Click to show notes for Vertical Angle The distance from the camera to the capture line must be within the viewing range of the LPR camera. Adjust the vertical angle so that the camera can read plates at all of their expected heights from the road. The maximum vertical angle allowed is 30°. Larger angles and/or greater mounting heights may be required in order to recognize plates on vehicles close to each other (such as in slow/congested traffic). At larger angles, the reflectivity of the plates is reduced, resulting in images with less contrast. For plates whose characters are very shiny (for example, silvery), the weighted angle must be less than 20 degrees. The weighted angle is the angle between a line from the camera to the plate, and a line running straight ahead from the vehicle. The camera should not be positioned so that the rays of the sun behind the camera shine along the camera-to-plate axis. Reflective plates will cause severe glare to be reflected back to the camera, obscuring the image of the plate’s characters. Avoid/mitigate by: Not installing the camera in an east/west direction Installing the camera near a building that shields it from the sun’s rays Installing the camera on a short pole Using a double-camera installation (2 different angles or front/rear) Figure 9. Sun Behind Camera (on Same Axis as Line-of-Sight from Camera to Plate) External illuminators can be used to enhance overview vehicle image quality, for front and/or rear capture. It is recommended to use an illuminator power supply separate from the camera’s supply. Figure 10. External Illuminator The wavelength of an external illuminator must be compatible with the wavelength of the internal illuminators of the Inex camera. The Inex IZ600F cameras are typically used with the IZL series illuminators. By using the following guidelines, you can match the illuminator to your Inex camera. The number of illuminator LEDs and beam angle must match the distance type (long or short) of the camera being used, as follows: Fewer LEDs and wider beam angles are used for short distances More LEDs and narrower beam angles are used for longer distances The results of applying these guidelines can be found in the following table: Table 2. Camera-to-Illuminator Recommended Setups Camera Illuminator Strobe Signal Night Image Installation IZ600F IZL1/2-IR-XXX N/A B/W Front IZ600F IZL1/2-WL-XX N/A Color Rear See the illuminator guides for further details about installation and mounting considerations (see Section 1). Mount illuminators at an appropriate distance away from their associated camera(s) , according to the objectives of your project. Contact Inex for guidance/training about this subject. Position the illuminator so you can aim it at the place where vehicles pass for recognition - while minimizing the glare into drivers' eyes. In most cases, however, white illuminators are mounted to be aimed at the rear of vehicles. Illuminator aiming is most effective at night. You can look at an infrared-type illuminator with a smartphone camera to see if it is working. Table 3. Additional Installation Considerations Item Considerations Surge Protection On power, network and data cables Correct, Stable and Sufficient Power Power undervoltage, overvoltage and/or incorrect polarity will damage the unit and will void the warranty. Stable power at the correct level must be supplied to each camera, even under a heavy processing load. Cable Extensions IMPORTANT All network cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded. Supplied cable lengths are approx. 5.5 in (14 cm) Power - Use a cable gauge sufficient to deliver 12 VDC at the camera LAN - Use only CAT 5e/6 cable for any extensions added to the LAN cable. The total length of the cable (without a switch) should not exceed 328 feet (100 meters). Cable Connection Waterproofing CAUTION Inex products must be mounted as described in their Installation Guides. If not, moisture problems may occur - which are not covered by the warranty. You must use a drip loop for the cable entering the camera. All cable connections from the camera to the power supply and LAN must be enclosed in a waterproof junction box (not provided). Unused connections must be sealed with waterproof insulating tape (such as butyl tape). Front/Rear Capture - or Both Country requirements Vehicle types Protruding parts that obscure plates (such as rear hooks) Recessed plates Trigger Hardware (such as inductive loops) Trigger device position Device is far enough away from other devices to minimize interference Point where vehicle is detected is close to capture line Minimize distance from trigger device to camera (reduces latency) Objects with character-like appearances (interpreted as characters on a plate, resulting in false reads); avoid having these items in the Field of View Fences with patterns Barriers Signs Obstructions (blocking FOV) Entry gates Trees and bushes (even before fully grown) Bright light (sun/artificial) shining directly into camera’s front window Reflective surfaces too close to camera lens Weather - snow, heavy rain, dust storms Dirt on front window (see Section 14.2) Bottom opening (screw cover) accessible To be able to perform a hardware (factory default) reset if needed (see Section 11.11) All network cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded. If you add extensions to cables, be sure that there are stable/correct signal and power levels delivered to all components. In this diagram, a dotted line box represents a waterproof junction box used to enclose connections from the camera to the LAN (and external power supply, if used). Note that the type and configuration of the power supply may be different than the one you are using at your site. (See the Quick Start guide for other wiring options.) Figure 11.

If you are using PoE, be sure that your PoE connection is compatible with IEEE 802.3af, and can provide 12 VDC at 1.2 Amp. The parts are in a separate plastic bag in the box. Figure 12. Assembling the Waterproof Cap Table 6. Waterproof Cap Components No. Component 1 Camera’s Network Interface Socket 2 O-Type Gasket (separate, in package) 3 Network Plug 4 Waterproof Endcap 5 Waterproof Rubber Gasket 6 Lock Nut 7 Network Cable from Router/Switch Unscrew the lock nut (6) from the waterproof endcap (4). Feed the network cable (without a plug at the end) (7) through the: Lock nut (6) Waterproof rubber gasket (5). The rubber gasket may already be mounted inside the endcap. If the rubber gasket is not mounted and has an inset ridge, the ridge must face the waterproof endcap (4) so it can fit on the ridge inside the endcap. Waterproof endcap (4) Crimp a male RJ-45 network plug (3) onto the end of the cable, taking care to insert the twisted pairs of wires in the correct order. Before mounting components, see Section 7 to ensure that your site plan accommodates how the components will be wired together. Prepare all wiring/cables between the system components, and from the system components to the camera’s mounting location (see Section 6 and Section 7.1). If needed, prepare all the conduits that cables will pass through. Mount other wiring-related components (such as junction boxes) in appropriate locations. Before mounting the camera, you will need to connect the LAN and other wires to be connected to other components (see Section 9). Secure the camera(s) and illuminator(s) to the appropriate mounting hardware (see the Mounting Hardware documentation - see Section 1). The IZ600F can be mounted on a wall or square pole using its built-in mounting bracket. You can also use an optional pole mount adapter (PMA) for pole mounting. To make a drip loop (required to prevent moisture from reaching the camera), adjust the camera’s base so that the notch through which the camera’s cable will pass is pointing down (see Figure 30). If you will be using external illuminator(s), mount them at an appropriate distance away from their associated camera(s), according to the objectives of your project. Contact Inex for guidance/training about this subject. Turn off/disconnect the external (AC) power supply before connecting cables. If you are using an Inex power supply, see its User Guide (see Section 1) for important information. Bring the base of the camera near the mounting location. Seat the O-type gasket (2) onto the end of the camera’s network interface socket (1) (see Figure 12). Ensure that the gasket lies flat on the socket, without gaps or twists (see Figure 13). Figure 13. Seating the O-type Gasket Insert the network plug (3) into the camera’s network interface socket (1). Figure 14. Inserting the Network Plug If needed, insert the rubber gasket (5) into the endcap (4). If there is a ridge, fit the rubber gasket inset ridge on the ridge inside the endcap. Figure 15. Rubber Gasket Inset Ridge: Fitting on Ridge Inside Endcap Align the tabs in the endcap with the open areas between the threads on the camera’s network interface socket (see Figure 16). Turn the endcap clockwise all the way (until the tabs fit into the grooves in the camera’s network interface socket). See Figure 16. Figure 16. Securing the Waterproof Jacket Connect the power and other wires. For a typical wiring diagram, see Section 7.1. For details about connections to external illuminators, see the relevant Illuminator guide (see Section 1). All connections from the camera to the power supply and LAN must be enclosed in a waterproof junction box. You must seal all unused connections with waterproof insulating tape, such as butyl tape (such as the BNC connector and multi-wire cable), the ferrite core in the middle of the cable and the cable splitter (see Figure 17). Figure 17. Insulating the Cable and Connections If any power cables were lengthened, ensure that all cameras receive exactly their rated voltage (see your camera’s User Guide). Power undervoltage, overvoltage and/or incorrect polarity will damage the unit and will void the warranty. Stable power at the correct level must be supplied to each camera, even when under a heavy processing load. Connect a plug to the Live (+V), Neutral (-V) and Ground (Shield) terminals of the power supply (see Section 7.1). Plug the power supply into the AC electricity. If required, switch the power supply unit ON. The Inex cameras have been pre-configured with default IP addresses. You will probably need to change these addresses to conform to the requirements of your network. Be sure that you have IP addresses reserved for all components of your ALPR system (RoadView computer and cameras). The IZ Discovery utility discovers all active devices connected to the network, and displays a list of their network parameters. These devices can include cameras and computers. See the IZ Discovery User Guide (see Section 1) for instructions on how to change a camera’s IP address. You can also use the camera’s configuration screens to change the IP address (see Section 11.6). To view the camera’s home page (see Figure 18): Open a browser. Enter the IP address of the camera into the address field. Figure 18. Camera’s Home Page Select the function you need from the links at the upper left: Click the Live button to see what the camera is currently viewing. You can also use the zoom and focus controls. Click to show notes for Live View When using Live View for the first time, you may be prompted to download and install an ActiveX control (Smart Viewer). If you do not have an internet connection to the network on which the camera is installed, wait 30 seconds, and you will be instructed on how to install the ActiveX control locally via the camera’s firmware. The stream of the Live View can also be accessed using an RTSP URL with this format : rtsp://[username:password]@/cam0_0 where cam0_0 is a camera-specific parameter (which in this case enables you to access the primary stream) To see the stream, use a video player such as the VLC player, located at: VLC If you need to change the camera’s IP address or other configuration parameters, click the Admin button. When prompted for a login, use the Administrator username/password credentials of root, IZpass12. The Administrator user name (root) cannot be changed, and the Administrator password is encrypted. Therefore, if someone changes the Administrator password, there is no way to find out the password if it gets lost. If the password gets lost, you will have to reset the device with the FD (Factory Default) button (see Section 11.11). All setting values will be reverted to their factory defaults. Close all windows, and the browser window. Figure 19. Configuration Elements Most configuration parameters may already have been pre-set for you. You only need to change the parameters described in the following sections. You can drill down to the configuration parameters as follows (see Figure 19): Category (bold); left sidebar; click to display this item’s nodes (a set of parameter groups). >>Parameter Group; click to display a set of parameter controls in the right-hand pane. After changing parameters, remember to click the \"Apply\" button at the end of each set of parameters (some parameter groups have more than one set). Figure 20. Access Level Parameters Your first action should be to set the Access Level to Full, with \"Encrypted & Unencrypted\" Authentication An Access Leve of \"Full\" will enable you to receive the video stream without any special user identification, so that: Anyone can use the Live View The RTSP URL can be used without a username and password to see the Live View If you change the Access Permission, click the Apply button under the Access Permission section. If you change the Authentication, click the Apply button in that section (you will be prompted to close the browser, and you will have to log in again). Figure 21. RTP/RTSP Parameters It is highly recommended to use a fixed IP address (not DHCP). A fixed IP address enables you to access the camera using the same URL every time, even after unexpected power outages. You can also use IZ Discovery to change the camera’s IP address (see Section 1). In the Network group, click on IP Address: Figure 22. Changing the Camera’s IP Address To change the IP address to a fixed one: The IP address must be unique within the entire ALPR system, and must be within the limits of standard IPv4 address numbering. Click the Static radio button. Enter the network address parameters. All cameras must be on the same subnet as both the computer you will use to communicate with and configure the camera, and the Inex RoadView computer. It is highly recommended to record the camera’s IP address and port number in a safe place. You will need them if the camera’s parameters are reset back to their defaults, and for configuring Inex recognition software. Click Apply. After selecting Apply, you will be requested to close your web browser so the updates can take effect. This will take 20 seconds or more, to allow the camera time to reboot. - If you click the browser’s Back button, all values will be discarded. - If you click the browser’s Refresh button, the application will load the previous values. In the IZ Discovery utility (see the IZ Discovery User Guide - see Section 1), click the \"Clear List\" button, and verify that the camera can be recognized with the new IP address. Figure 23. Date & Time The Time Zone selections are organized by continent. For example, the \"America/\" prefix covers various cities and countries in North America (U.S. and Canada) and South America. The \"Period\" is the interval (in seconds) at which the time server will be polled for updates. Figure 24. Stream Setup Parameters Three video streams are available for use, each with its own RTSP URL. The URLs are: rtsp:///cam0_n, where n is 0,1 or 2 for the primary, secondary or tertiary streams, respectively. Inex uses the \"primary\" stream, which can supply video for up to 3 clients. Note the following details about some of the parameters: Max Frame Rate For U.S. (60 Hz electricity) - 30 fps For Europe (50 Hz electricity) - 25 fps Primary/Seconday/Tertiary - be sure to click \"Primary\" (turns red) If any additional parameters appear below the main two sets of parameters, leave them at their defaults (depends on camera model) Figure 25. Camera Setup Parameters Note the following details about some of the parameters: Mode - click on \"Default(Day)\"; turns red Shutter Control is set to Manual - means that the shutter speed will be chosen automatically between the Shutter Time Min and Max Disable motion detection: Figure 26. Motion Detection In some cases (such as if the Administrator password is lost), you will need to perform a hardware reset using the FD (Factory Default) button. All setting values will be reverted to their factory defaults. The IP address will be reset to 10.20.30.40. To perform a hardware reset: Unscrew the round cover on the bottom of the camera: Figure 27. Unscrewing the Round Cover Locate the Factory Default (reset) button (see Figure 28). Using a thin item such as a small screwdriver, hold the button down for several seconds until the communication LEDs shut off. The 2 communication LEDs (red/flashing and green/static) are mounted next to each another on the same side of the circuit board you see. After the communication LEDs shut off, wait until they light up again. You can then use the camera and configure its parameters. Figure 28. Factory Default (Reset) Button and LEDs Move a vehicle next to, and at the middle of the capture line. (This is the position at which the vehicle sensor signals that the vehicle is present.) Ensure that the Camera System is aimed at the middle of the lane, and is at the required capture distance (see Section 6 and the IZ600F User Guide - see Section 1). Alternatively, in a lab, position a license plate at the expected distance and height. See the IZ Discovery User Guide (see Section 1). Open a browser (Chrome or Microsoft Edge). Type in the IP address of the RoadView computer. For example: 192.168.5.110 You will see the login screen. Enter the default username and password (root, root): Figure 29. Logging In to RoadView You should see the RoadView Live (Journal) tab. See the RoadView ALPR User Guide for instructions for configuring and using RoadView (see Section 1). See the RoadView ALPR User Guide (see Section 1) for logout instructions, using the multi-line dropdown menu icon in the upper right corner of the screen. See Section 12.2 and Section 12.3 for instructions on how to log in to the computer running RoadView in your system. See the RoadView ALPR User Guide (see Section 1) for calibration instructions. Read the following instructions before adjusting the camera’s position as part of the calibration procedure; they are specifically for the IZ600F camera. DO NOT OVERTIGHTEN the two Roll screws (3). Excess force can cause the screws to break! There are two Roll screws - one on each side. To aim the camera, adjust the Pan (screw 2), Tilt (screw 1) and Roll (screw 3) as described in these instructions, and in the RoadView ALPR User Guide (see Section 1). Use the 3 mm Allen/hex key provided to loosen and tighten the adjustment screws. Figure 30. Pan/Tilt/Roll (Angle) Adjustments The inner mechanisms of adjustments 2 (pan) and 1 (tilt) (see Figure 30) have small teeth. When the teeth mesh with protrusions in the housing, the adjustment position becomes fixed in place. Each tooth corresponds to a certain number of degrees of angle (6° per tooth). However, the distance between each tooth is not always small enough for finer adjustments (that are often required to aim the camera). If the camera is used with a pole mount adapter, you can achieve these finer adjustments by moving the adapter slightly - around the pole. Using a license plate mounted in a lab, or by driving a vehicle through the lane, verify that an Event is generated with the correct plate read (recorded in the RoadView Live (Journal) tab). See the RoadView ALPR User Guide (see Section 1). Once the lane is active, verify that Events are being generated for each vehicle passing each camera, and that the recognition has sufficient accuracy and confidence. It is recommended to check all mounting screws for proper tightness once every two years. Do not use solvents or strong abrasive detergent when cleaning the camera. Use a soft dry cloth to clean the ALPR camera’s front glass when it is dirty. If the dirt has hardened, remove it using mild soap and water, and then wipe the front window gently.

Pole mount adapter (PMA) - see the Mounting Hardware documentation (see Section 1) External Illuminator - Can be used to enhance overview vehicle image quality, for front and/or rear capture. It is recommended to use an illuminator power supply separate from the camera’s supply. Mount illuminators at an appropriate distance away from their associated camera(s), according to the objectives of your project. Contact Inex for guidance/training about this subject. Position the illuminator so you can aim it at the place where vehicles pass for recognition - while minimizing the glare into drivers' eyes. In most cases, however, white illuminators are mounted to be aimed at the rear of vehicles. Illuminator aiming is most effective at night. The IZ Discovery utility discovers all active devices connected to the network, and displays a list of their network parameters. These devices can include cameras and computers. See the IZ Discovery User Guide (see Section 1). See your camera’s Installation Guide for detailed instructions (see Section 1.)

(For a detailed view of the cables, see Figure 9.) Figure 1. Package Contents The package includes: IZA500G/GR ALPR All-in-one AI Camera System If any parts are missing or damaged, please contact Inex Technologies. The following accessories can be supplied by INEX/TECH, For documentation and part numbers, see Section 1. Table 2. Required Accessories Item Notes 24 VDC (or 48 VDC for P48 models using DC input) power supply (voltage-adjustable) INEX/TECH model power supply. (If you use an external illuminator, it is recommended to use an illuminator power supply separate from the Camera System’s supply.) PoE++ Injector Required for P48 models when using PoE+ power input Mounting Hardware (pan-tilt-roll bracket) Typically on gantry or wall/pole; see the Mounting Hardware documentation for details (see Section 1). For documentation and part numbers, see Section 1. IZIO Digital I/O Controller Loop Detector External Illuminators An Allen wrench used to attach the mounting adapter plate to the housing (if applicable); size 3/16\" (4.76 mm) Network (LAN) cabling (typically CAT 5e/6 cable) with metal-body RJ45 connectors. The total length of the cable should not exceed 328 feet (100 meters). Tools for building LAN cables (wire stripper, crimp tool, etc.) and RJ45 connectors with metal bodies. For installations that require network cabling: typically use CAT 5e/6 cable. The total length of the cable should not exceed 328 feet (100 meters). All network cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded. You will need to provide a laptop computer to use for configuration. If you will be using the laptop outdoors, the screen must be able to be seen in strong sunlight. Required software: Windows 10 or above - with .NET 4.5 enabled in \"Windows Features\" Chrome or Microsoft Edge browser Your camera’s Field of View (FOV) is the area that the camera can \"see\". You can think of this area as an imaginary rectangle rising from the lane upwards. The width of this area is called the horizontal FOV or \"capture line\". See your camera’s User Guide for the horizontal and vertical FOV specifications. Figure 2. Field of View (Capture Line) Select your camera’s position so that license plates are always within the capture line and parallel to it, with the camera facing as straight at the plates as possible - as shown in the following diagrams: Figure 3. Plates Within Capture Line Figure 4. Plates Parallel to Capture Line - Away from Road Curves The maximum horizontal angle allowed is 30° (to the farthest point at the end of the capture line). The maximum vertical angle allowed is 30°. Installations that position the camera at significant angles in relation to the plates will reduce the line-of-sight distances specified. Figure 5. Horizontal Camera Angle (Pan Angle) Click to show notes for Horizontal Angle The maximum horizontal angle allowed is 30° (to the farthest point at the end of the capture line). If you must capture plates on a curve, place the camera on the side of the road that minimizes the horizontal angle. At larger angles, the reflectivity of the plates is reduced, resulting in images with less contrast. For plates whose characters are very shiny (for example, silvery), the weighted angle must be less than 20 degrees. The weighted angle is the angle between a line from the camera to the plate, and a line running straight ahead from the vehicle. Figure 6. Vertical Camera Angle (Tilt Angle) and Line-of-Sight Distance from Plate Click to show notes for Vertical Angle The distance from the camera to the capture line must be within the viewing range of the LPR camera. Adjust the vertical angle so that the camera can read plates at all of their expected heights from the road. The maximum vertical angle allowed is 30°. Larger angles and/or greater mounting heights may be required in order to recognize plates on vehicles close to each other (such as in slow/congested traffic). At larger angles, the reflectivity of the plates is reduced, resulting in images with less contrast. For plates whose characters are very shiny (for example, silvery), the weighted angle must be less than 20 degrees. The weighted angle is the angle between a line from the camera to the plate, and a line running straight ahead from the vehicle. The camera should not be positioned so that the rays of the sun behind the camera shine along the camera-to-plate axis. Reflective plates will cause severe glare to be reflected back to the camera, obscuring the image of the plate’s characters. Avoid/mitigate by: Not installing the camera in an east/west direction Installing the camera near a building that shields it from the sun’s rays Installing the camera on a short pole Using a double-camera installation (2 different angles or front/rear) Figure 7. Sun Behind Camera (on Same Axis as Line-of-Sight from Camera to Plate) External illuminators can be used to enhance overview vehicle image quality, for front and/or rear capture. It is recommended to use an illuminator power supply separate from the Camera System’s supply. Figure 8. External Illuminator The wavelength of an external illuminator must be compatible with the wavelength of the internal illuminators of the Inex Camera System. The Inex IZA500G/GR Camera Systems are typically used with the IZL series illuminators. By using the following guidelines, you can match the illuminator to your Inex Camera System. The number of illuminator LEDs and beam angle must match the distance type (long or short) of the Camera System being used, as follows: Fewer LEDs and wider beam angles are used for short distances More LEDs and narrower beam angles are used for longer distances The results of applying these guidelines can be found in the following table: Table 3. Camera-to-Illuminator Recommended Setups Camera Illuminator Strobe Signal Night Image Installation IZA500G/IZA500GR IZL1/2-IR-XXX N/A B/W Front IZA500G/IZA500GR IZL1/2-WL-XX N/A Color Rear See the illuminator guides for further details about installation and mounting considerations (see Section 1). Mount illuminators at an appropriate distance away from their associated Camera System(s) , according to the objectives of your project. Contact Inex for guidance/training about this subject. Position the illuminator so you can aim it at the place where vehicles pass for recognition - while minimizing the glare into drivers' eyes. In most cases, however, white illuminators are mounted to be aimed at the rear of vehicles. Illuminator aiming is most effective at night. You can look at an infrared-type illuminator with a smartphone camera to see if it is working. Table 4. Additional Installation Considerations Item Considerations Surge Protection On power, network and data cables Correct, Stable and Sufficient Power Power undervoltage, overvoltage and/or incorrect polarity will damage the unit and will void the warranty. Stable power at the correct level must be supplied to each Camera System, even when under a heavy processing load. Cable Extensions IMPORTANT All network cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded. Power - Use a cable gauge sufficient to deliver the required voltage at the Camera System LAN - Use only CAT 5e/6 cable for any extensions added to the LAN cable. The total length of the cable (without a switch) should not exceed 328 feet (100 meters). Front/Rear Capture - or Both Country requirements Vehicle types Protruding parts that obscure plates (such as rear hooks) Recessed plates Desired pre- or post-capture in relation to ticket issue (for parking) Objects with character-like appearances (interpreted as characters on a plate, resulting in false reads) Avoid having these items in the Field of View: Fences with patterns Barriers Signs Obstructions (blocking FOV) Entry gates Trees and bushes (even before fully grown) Bright light (sun/artificial) shining directly into Camera System’s front window Reflective surfaces too close to camera lens Weather - snow, heavy rain, dust storms Dirt on front window (see Section 13) Mounting Typically on wall/pole Additional construction if needed The trigger wires have the same functions and colors as shown here, but the label on the cable may be worded differently. When adding extensions to the built-in cables, be sure that there are stable/correct signal and power levels delivered to all components. For installations that require network cabling: typically use CAT 5e/6 cable. The total length of the cable should not exceed 328 feet (100 meters). All network cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded. Figure 9. Cable Details Before mounting components, see Section 8 to ensure that your site plan accommodates how the components will be wired together. After mounting, remove the protective film from the front window of the Camera System. Secure the Camera System(s) and illuminator(s) to the appropriate mounting hardware (see the Mounting Hardware documentation - see Section 1). Mount other components (such as junction boxes) in appropriate locations. See Table 5 for a legend/bill of materials. Turn off/disconnect the external (AC) power supply before connecting cables. If you are using an Inex power supply, see its User Guide (see Section 1) for important information. If you are using a DIN rail-mount power supply, you will need to cut off the rings at the ends of the Camera System’s power connections, and attach pins in their place. Figure 10.

If you need to use an external illuminator, see Table 3 for a table of Camera-to-Illuminator Recommended Setups. The IZ4POE is required for the PoE+ input power option. If any power cables were lengthened, ensure that all components receive exactly their rated voltage. Power undervoltage, overvoltage and/or incorrect polarity will damage the unit and will void the warranty. Stable power at the correct level must be supplied to each Camera System, even when under a heavy processing load. Connect a plug to the Live (+V), Neutral (-V) and Ground (Shield) terminals of the power supply (see Section 8.1). Plug the power supply into the AC electricity. If required, switch the power supply unit ON. The Inex cameras have been pre-configured with default IP addresses. You will probably need to change these addresses to conform to the requirements of your network. Be sure that you have IP addresses reserved for all components of your ALPR system (RoadView computer and cameras). The IZ Discovery utility discovers all active devices connected to the network, and displays a list of their network parameters. These devices can include cameras and computers. See the IZ Discovery User Guide (see Section 1) for instructions on how to change a Camera System’s IP address. To view the camera’s home page (see Figure 14): Open a browser. Enter the IP address of the camera into the address field. Figure 14. Camera’s Home Page Select the function you need from the links at the upper left: Click the Live button to see what the camera is currently viewing. You can also use the zoom and focus controls. Click to show notes for Live View When using Live View for the first time, you may be prompted to download and install an ActiveX control (Smart Viewer). If you do not have an internet connection to the network on which the camera is installed, wait 30 seconds, and you will be instructed on how to install the ActiveX control locally via the camera’s firmware. The stream of the Live View can also be accessed using an RTSP URL with this format : rtsp://[username:password]@/cam0_0 where cam0_0 is a camera-specific parameter (which in this case enables you to access the primary stream) To see the stream, use a video player such as the VLC player, located at: VLC If you need to change the camera’s IP address or other configuration parameters, click the Admin button. When prompted for a login, use the Administrator username/password credentials of root, IZpass12. The Administrator user name (root) cannot be changed, and the Administrator password is encrypted. Therefore, if someone changes the Administrator password, there is no way to find out the password if it gets lost. It is highly recommended to use a fixed IP address (not DHCP). A fixed IP address enables you to access the camera using the same URL every time, even after unexpected power outages. You can also use IZ Discovery to change the camera’s IP address (see Section 1). In the Network group, click on IP Address: Figure 15. Changing the Camera’s IP Address To change the IP address to a fixed one: The IP address must be unique within the entire ALPR system, and must be within the limits of standard IPv4 address numbering. Click the Static radio button. Enter the network address parameters. All cameras must be on the same subnet as both the computer you will use to communicate with and configure the camera, and the Inex RoadView computer. It is highly recommended to record the camera’s IP address and port number in a safe place. You will need them if the camera’s parameters are reset back to their defaults, and for configuring Inex recognition software. Click Apply. After selecting Apply, you will be requested to close your web browser so the updates can take effect. This will take 20 seconds or more, to allow the camera time to reboot. - If you click the browser’s Back button, all values will be discarded. - If you click the browser’s Refresh button, the application will load the previous values. In the IZ Discovery utility (see the IZ Discovery User Guide - see Section 1), click the \"Clear List\" button, and verify that the camera can be recognized with the new IP address. Camera settings are typically set by Inex. Close all windows, and the browser window. There are two cameras in the Camera System. Both are calibrated in nearly the same way. The LPR camera is set to capture in black and white, and the Overview (OV) camera is set to capture in color. The OV camera can be used both to display an overview image, and to perform LPR recognition. You may even be able to improve read accuracy by changing the zoom to have one camera \"see\" closer than the other one. Move a vehicle next to, and at the middle of the capture line. (This is the position at which the vehicle sensor signals that the vehicle is present.) Ensure that the Camera System is aimed at the middle of the lane, and is at the required capture distance (see Section 5 and the IZA500G/GR User Guide - see Section 1). Alternatively, in a lab, position a license plate at the expected distance and height. See the IZ Discovery User Guide (see Section 1). Open a browser (Chrome or Microsoft Edge). Type in the IP address of the RoadView computer. For example: 192.168.5.110 You will see the login screen. Enter the default username and password (root, root): Figure 16. Logging In to RoadView You should see the RoadView Live (Journal) tab. See the RoadView ALPR User Guide for instructions for configuring and using RoadView (see Section 1). See the RoadView ALPR User Guide (see Section 1) for logout instructions, using the multi-line dropdown menu icon in the upper right corner of the screen. See the RoadView ALPR User Guide (see Section 1) for calibration instructions. Using a license plate mounted in a lab, or by driving a vehicle through the lane, verify that an Event is generated with the correct plate read (recorded in the RoadView Live (Journal) tab - see the RoadView ALPR User Guide). See Section 1. Once the lane is active, verify that Events are being generated for each vehicle passing each camera, and that the recognition has sufficient accuracy and confidence. See the RoadView ALPR User Guide (see Section 1). It is recommended to check all mounting screws for proper tightness once every two years. Do not use solvents or strong abrasive detergent when cleaning the Camera System. Use a soft dry cloth to clean the ALPR Camera System’s front glass when it is dirty. If the dirt has hardened, remove it using mild soap and water, and then wipe the front window gently. Inex Technologies reserves the right to improve and enhance its product offerings.

The following accessories can be supplied by INEX/TECH. For documentation and part numbers, see Section 1. Table 2. Required Accessories Item Notes 24VDC power supply (voltage-adjustable) INEX/TECH model power supply. (If you use an external illuminator, it is recommended to use an illuminator power supply separate from the Camera System’s supply.) Mounting Hardware (pan-tilt-roll bracket) Typically on gantry or wall/pole; see the Mounting Hardware documentation for details (see Section 1). For documentation and part numbers, see Section 1. Prefabricated Power/Signals and LAN cables IZIO Digital I/O Controller External Illuminators An Allen wrench used to attach the mounting adapter plate to the housing (if applicable); size 3/16\" (4.76 mm) 8-wire cable for power/signals; recommended to use E119932-1/LL84201, 24 gauge (size of each wire); see Section 6.1. 2 mm flat screwdriver for tightening the screw terminals of the power/signals connector (see Section 6.1). 16 mm torque wrench for tightening the nuts of the power/signals connector, and for attaching the connector to the Camera System. Network (LAN) cabling (typically CAT 5e/6 cable) with metal-body RJ45 connectors. The total length of the cable should not exceed 328 feet (100 meters). See Section 6.2 for important LAN cable information. Tools for building LAN cables (wire stripper, crimp tool, etc.) and RJ45 connectors with metal bodies. For installations that require network cabling: typically use CAT 5e/6 cable. The total length of the cable should not exceed 328 feet (100 meters). All network cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded. You will need to provide a laptop computer to use for configuration. If you will be using the laptop outdoors, the screen must be able to be seen in strong sunlight. Required software: Windows 10 or above - with .NET 4.5 enabled in \"Windows Features\" Chrome or Microsoft Edge browser Your camera’s Field of View (FOV) is the area that the camera can \"see\". You can think of this area as an imaginary rectangle rising from the lane upwards. The width of this area is called the horizontal FOV or \"capture line\". See your camera’s User Guide for the horizontal and vertical FOV specifications. Figure 3. Field of View (Capture Line) Select your camera’s position so that license plates are always within the capture line and parallel to it, with the camera facing as straight at the plates as possible - as shown in the following diagrams: Figure 4. Plates Within Capture Line Figure 5. Plates Parallel to Capture Line - Away from Road Curves The maximum horizontal angle allowed is 30° (to the farthest point at the end of the capture line). The maximum vertical angle allowed is 30°. Installations that position the camera at significant angles in relation to the plates will reduce the line-of-sight distances specified. Figure 6. Horizontal Camera Angle (Pan Angle) Click to show notes for Horizontal Angle The maximum horizontal angle allowed is 30° (to the farthest point at the end of the capture line). If you must capture plates on a curve, place the camera on the side of the road that minimizes the horizontal angle. At larger angles, the reflectivity of the plates is reduced, resulting in images with less contrast. For plates whose characters are very shiny (for example, silvery), the weighted angle must be less than 20 degrees. The weighted angle is the angle between a line from the camera to the plate, and a line running straight ahead from the vehicle. Figure 7. Vertical Camera Angle (Tilt Angle) and Line-of-Sight Distance from Plate Click to show notes for Vertical Angle The distance from the camera to the capture line must be within the viewing range of the LPR camera. Adjust the vertical angle so that the camera can read plates at all of their expected heights from the road. The maximum vertical angle allowed is 30°. Larger angles and/or greater mounting heights may be required in order to recognize plates on vehicles close to each other (such as in slow/congested traffic). At larger angles, the reflectivity of the plates is reduced, resulting in images with less contrast. For plates whose characters are very shiny (for example, silvery), the weighted angle must be less than 20 degrees. The weighted angle is the angle between a line from the camera to the plate, and a line running straight ahead from the vehicle. The camera should not be positioned so that the rays of the sun behind the camera shine along the camera-to-plate axis. Reflective plates will cause severe glare to be reflected back to the camera, obscuring the image of the plate’s characters. Avoid/mitigate by: Not installing the camera in an east/west direction Installing the camera near a building that shields it from the sun’s rays Installing the camera on a short pole Using a double-camera installation (2 different angles or front/rear) Figure 8. Sun Behind Camera (on Same Axis as Line-of-Sight from Camera to Plate) External illuminators can be used to enhance overview vehicle image quality, for front and/or rear capture. It is recommended to use an illuminator power supply separate from the Camera System’s supply. Figure 9. External Illuminator The wavelength of an external illuminator must be compatible with the wavelength of the internal illuminators of the Inex Camera System. The Inex IZA800G Camera Systems are typically used with the IZS series strobe illuminators. By using the following guidelines, you can match the illuminator to your Inex Camera System. The number of illuminator LEDs and beam angle must match the distance type (long or short) of the Camera System being used, as follows: Fewer LEDs and wider beam angles are used for short distances More LEDs and narrower beam angles are used for longer distances The results of applying these guidelines can be found in the following table: Table 3. Camera-to-Illuminator Recommended Setups Camera Illuminator Strobe Signal Night Image Installation IZA800G-L/XL-xx IZS2-WL-20 OV Strobe Color Rear IZA800G-S-xx IZS1-WL-H40 IZS1-WL-30 IZA800G-L/XL-xx IZS2-IR-20 OV Strobe B/W Front IZA800G-S-xx IZS1-IR-H40 IZS1-IR-30 You can trigger an illuminator from the OV camera by using appropriate wiring (see Section 8.1). The pulse width and other parameters that affect illuminator operation are pre-configured according to your project’s requirements. See the illuminator guides for further details about installation and mounting considerations (see Section 1). Mount illuminators at an appropriate distance away from their associated Camera System(s) , according to the objectives of your project. Contact Inex for guidance/training about this subject. Position the illuminator so you can aim it at the place where vehicles pass for recognition - while minimizing the glare into drivers' eyes. In most cases, however, white illuminators are mounted to be aimed at the rear of vehicles. Illuminator aiming is most effective at night. You can look at an infrared-type illuminator with a smartphone camera to see if it is working. Table 4. Additional Installation Considerations Item Considerations Surge Protection On power, network and data cables Correct, Stable and Sufficient Power Power undervoltage, overvoltage and/or incorrect polarity will damage the unit and will void the warranty. Stable power at the correct level must be supplied to each Camera System, even when under a heavy processing load. Cable Extensions IMPORTANT All network cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded. Power - Use a cable gauge sufficient to deliver 24 VDC at the Camera System LAN - Use only CAT 5e/6 cable for any extensions added to the LAN cable. The total length of the cable should not exceed 328 feet (100 meters). In order to use the connector included with the Camera System, the outer diameter of the LAN cable must be in the range of 0.20\" to 0.25\" (5.0 to 6.5 mm). Front/Rear Capture - or Both Country requirements Vehicle types Protruding parts that obscure plates (such as rear hooks) Recessed plates Objects with character-like appearances (interpreted as characters on a plate, resulting in false reads) Avoid having these items in the Field of View: Fences with patterns Barriers Signs Obstructions (blocking FOV) Entry gates Trees and bushes (even before fully grown) Bright light (sun/artificial) shining directly into Camera System’s front window Weather - snow, heavy rain, dust storms Dirt on front window (see Section 13) Mounting Typically gantry (can also be on wall/pole) Additional construction if needed Prefabricated cables can be ordered from Inex. See Section 1 and Table 6. At the end of this procedure, you will need to check that there is conductivity from the shield wire (at the power supply end of the cable) to the body of the connector that will be connected to the Camera System. Use the cable type recommended in the Required Accessories section (see Section 4.2). Lay out the parts from the power connector package. Figure 10. Power/Signals Cable: Laying Out Connector Parts Thread the cable through the sealing nut and rubber seal. Figure 11. Power/Signals Cable: Threading Cable Through Sealing Nut and Rubber Seal Prepare the cable shielding: Thread the cable all the way through the clamp cage body. Strip off the outer insulation of the cable, leaving the individual insulated wires exposed to a length of 18mm. Be careful not to cut into the inner foil and plastic jackets (casings) surrounding the individual insulated wires. Slit the foil jacket, and bend it back onto the outer insulation. Carefully cut away the plastic jacket enclosing the individual insulated wires. Wrap the shield wire (the one without insulation) 1-2 times around the foil jacket that you bent back. Figure 12. Power/Signals Cable: Stripping Off the Outer Insulation Peel the backing off of the conductive foil to expose the adhesive. Figure 13. Power/Signals Cable: Peeling Backing off Conductive Foil Wrap the conductive foil around the point at which the outer insulation was stripped, to cover and make contact with the shield wire and foil jacket. Figure 14. Power/Signals Cable: Wrapping Conductive Foil Around Shield Wire and Jacket Strip off 5 mm from each individual wire. Insert each wire into its appropriate screw terminal, and tighten with a 2 mm flat screwdriver. The suggested wire colors and pinouts are shown in the following Figures. The notch between pins 1 and 2 on the face of the connector corresponds to the notch on the circular body of the screw terminals. Table 5.

Power/Signals Cable: Attaching the Wires to the Screw Terminals Insert the screw terminals body into the clamp cage housing. Note how the tabs on the screw terminals fit into the grooves in the clamp cage housing. Figure 16. Power/Signals Cable: Inserting Screw Terminals' Tabs into Clamp Cage Housing Verify that the conductive foil is now making contact with the spring sleeve protrusions inside the clamp cage housing. Use a 16 mm torque wrench to tighten the nut that fastens the clamp cage housing to the screw terminals body (torque 4-6 kgf.cm / 0.39-0.59 N.m.). Figure 17. Power/Signals Cable: Foil in Contact with Spring Inside Clamp Cage Housing Slide the sealing nut along the cable, and insert it in between the clamp cage protrusions. Figure 18. Power Cable: Inserting the Sealing Nut into the Clamp Cage Using a 16 mm wrench, tighten the nut that seals the end of the clamp cage housing. (torque 4-6 kgf.cm / 0.39-0.59 N.m.). Verify that the sealing nut is in tight contact with the inner body of the nut (to provide insulation against moisture). The sealing nut may pucker a bit due to the pressure of the nut; this is normal. Figure 19. Power Cable: Tightening the Nut to Seal the Clamp Cage The point in the cable at which you will be connecting the power wires (+, - and ground) to the power supply may be in the middle of the cable. (This part of the cable is typically inside a connection box to seal all connections from moisture.) Strip off a portion of outer insulation of the cable at the end you will be connecting to the power supply. Remove enough insulation so the shield wire will be long enough to wrap several times around the foil jacket (see next steps) and come out of the cable to reach the power supply ground wire. Be careful not to cut into the inner foil and plastic jackets (casings) surrounding the individual insulated wires. Slit the foil jacket, and bend it back onto the outer insulation. Leave enough foil exposed so the shield wire can be wrapped several times around the foil. Carefully cut away the plastic jacket enclosing the individual insulated wires. Wrap the shield wire (the one without insulation) several times around the foil jacket that you bent back. There must be a tight contact between the shield wire and the foil. Figure 20. Power Cable: Wrapping the Shield Wire at Power Supply End IMPORTANT: Check that there is conductivity from the shield wire (at the power supply end of the cable) to the body of the connector that will be connected to the camera. You can seal the shield wire wrapping on the cable with insulation tape or heat shrink tubing. Connect the shield wire to the ground wire of the power supply. You may need to extend the shield wire by soldering an additional wire on to it. Connect the (+) and (-) wires from the cable to the power supply. Figure 21. Power Cable: Connecting the Cable Wires to the Power Supply Connect the remaining signal wires (see Section 8). Prefabricated cables can be ordered from Inex. See Section 1 and Table 6. Click to show Important notes for LAN cable construction If you are building your own LAN cables, you must use RJ45 connectors with metal bodies. You must ensure that there is conductivity between the bodies of the connectors at each end of the cable. You can do this by extracting the cable’s shield wire before attaching the connector to the cable, and then soldering the shield wire to the body of the connector (see the following Figures). The outer diameter of the LAN cable must be in the range of 0.20\" to 0.25\" (5.0 to 6.5 mm). If you are using prefabricated CAT 5e/6 cables with metal-body RJ45 connectors, the shield wires have typically already been connected to each connector body. However, you must still check that there is conductivity between the bodies of the connectors at each end of the cable. Figure 22. LAN Cable: Extracting the Shield Wire Figure 23. LAN Cable: Shield Wire Soldered to Connector Body Lay out the parts from the network (LAN) connector package. Figure 24. LAN Cable: Connector Parts Slip the sealing nut over the RJ45 connector onto the LAN cable, with the inner threads in the direction of the RJ45 connector. Figure 25. LAN Cable: Slipping Sealing Nut Over RJ45 Connector Open the rubber sealing ring at its split, and put it on the cable. Figure 26. LAN Cable: Attaching Rubber Sealing Ring to Cable Orient the support plastic with the wider side (with the thinner walls) towards the RJ45 connector. Put the support plastic on the cable (the split can expand slightly). Figure 27. LAN Cable: Attaching the Support Plastic to the Cable Gently push the RJ45 connector into the housing until it fits snugly in the cutout in the housing. Figure 28. LAN Cable: Inserting RJ45 into Housing Cutout Insert the support plastic into the housing, followed by the rubber sealing ring. Seat the rubber sealing ring between the housing’s teeth as far in as it will go. Figure 29. LAN Cable: Inserting the Support Plastic and Rubber Ring into the Housing Tighten the sealing nut (torque 8-15 kgf.cm / 0.78-1.47 N.m.). Figure 30. LAN Cable: Completed Assembly Before mounting components, see Section 8 to ensure that your site plan accommodates how the components will be wired together. After mounting, remove the protective film from the front window of the Camera System. Secure the Camera System(s) and illuminator(s) to the appropriate mounting hardware (see the Mounting Hardware documentation - see Section 1). Mount other components (such as junction boxes) in appropriate locations. See Table 5 for the power/signals cable wire colors, and Table 6 for a legend/bill of materials. Turn off/disconnect the external (AC) power supply before connecting cables. If you are using an Inex power supply, see its User Guide (see Section 1) for important information. The torques required to connect the cable connectors to the connectors on the Camera System are as follows: Power/signals cable: 3-4 kgf.cm / 0.29-0.39 N.m. LAN cable: 5-8 kgf.cm / 0.49-0.78 N.m.

Power undervoltage, overvoltage and/or incorrect polarity will damage the unit and will void the warranty. Stable power at the correct level must be supplied to each Camera System, even when under a heavy processing load. Connect a plug to the Live (+V), Neutral (-V) and Ground (Shield) terminals of the power supply (see Section 8.1). Plug the power supply into the AC electricity. If required, switch the power supply unit ON. The Inex cameras have been pre-configured with default IP addresses. You will probably need to change these addresses to conform to the requirements of your network. Be sure that you have IP addresses reserved for all components of your ALPR system (RoadView computer and cameras). The IZ Discovery utility discovers all active devices connected to the network, and displays a list of their network parameters. These devices can include cameras and computers. See the IZ Discovery User Guide (see Section 1) for instructions on how to change a Camera System’s IP address. To view the camera’s home page (see Figure 33): Open a browser. Enter the IP address of the camera into the address field. Figure 33. Camera’s Home Page Select the function you need from the links at the upper left: Click the Live button to see what the camera is currently viewing. You can also use the zoom and focus controls. Click to show notes for Live View When using Live View for the first time, you may be prompted to download and install an ActiveX control (Smart Viewer). If you do not have an internet connection to the network on which the camera is installed, wait 30 seconds, and you will be instructed on how to install the ActiveX control locally via the camera’s firmware. The stream of the Live View can also be accessed using an RTSP URL with this format : rtsp://[username:password]@/cam0_0 where cam0_0 is a camera-specific parameter (which in this case enables you to access the primary stream) To see the stream, use a video player such as the VLC player, located at: VLC If you need to change the camera’s IP address or other configuration parameters, click the Admin button. When prompted for a login, use the Administrator username/password credentials of root, IZpass12. The Administrator user name (root) cannot be changed, and the Administrator password is encrypted. Therefore, if someone changes the Administrator password, there is no way to find out the password if it gets lost. It is highly recommended to use a fixed IP address (not DHCP). A fixed IP address enables you to access the camera using the same URL every time, even after unexpected power outages. You can also use IZ Discovery to change the camera’s IP address (see Section 1). In the Network group, click on IP Address: Figure 34. Changing the Camera’s IP Address To change the IP address to a fixed one: The IP address must be unique within the entire ALPR system, and must be within the limits of standard IPv4 address numbering. Click the Static radio button. Enter the network address parameters. All cameras must be on the same subnet as both the computer you will use to communicate with and configure the camera, and the Inex RoadView computer. It is highly recommended to record the camera’s IP address and port number in a safe place. You will need them if the camera’s parameters are reset back to their defaults, and for configuring Inex recognition software. Click Apply. After selecting Apply, you will be requested to close your web browser so the updates can take effect. This will take 20 seconds or more, to allow the camera time to reboot. - If you click the browser’s Back button, all values will be discarded. - If you click the browser’s Refresh button, the application will load the previous values. In the IZ Discovery utility (see the IZ Discovery User Guide - see Section 1), click the \"Clear List\" button, and verify that the camera can be recognized with the new IP address. Camera settings are typically set by Inex. Close all windows, and the browser window. There are two cameras in the Camera System. Both are calibrated in nearly the same way. The LPR camera is set to capture in black and white, and the Overview (OV) camera is set to capture in color. The OV camera can be used both to display an overview image, and to perform LPR recognition. You may even be able to improve read accuracy by changing the zoom to have one camera \"see\" closer than the other one. Move a vehicle next to, and at the middle of the capture line. (This is the position at which the vehicle sensor signals that the vehicle is present.) Ensure that the Camera System is aimed at the middle of the lane, and is at the required capture distance (see Section 5 and the IZA800G User Guide - see Section 1). Alternatively, in a lab, position a license plate at the expected distance and height. See the IZ Discovery User Guide (see Section 1). Open a browser (Chrome or Microsoft Edge). Type in the IP address of the RoadView computer. For example: 192.168.5.110 You will see the login screen. Enter the default username and password (root, root): Figure 35. Logging In to RoadView You should see the RoadView Live (Journal) tab. See the RoadView ALPR User Guide for instructions for configuring and using RoadView (see Section 1). See the RoadView ALPR User Guide (see Section 1) for logout instructions, using the multi-line dropdown menu icon in the upper right corner of the screen. See the RoadView ALPR User Guide (see Section 1) for calibration instructions. Using a license plate mounted in a lab, or by driving a vehicle through the lane, verify that an Event is generated with the correct plate read (recorded in the RoadView Live (Journal) tab - see the RoadView ALPR User Guide). See Section 1. Once the lane is active, verify that Events are being generated for each vehicle passing each camera, and that the recognition has sufficient accuracy and confidence. See the RoadView ALPR User Guide (see Section 1). It is recommended to check all mounting screws for proper tightness once every two years. Do not use solvents or strong abrasive detergent when cleaning the Camera System. Use a soft dry cloth to clean the ALPR Camera System’s front glass when it is dirty. If the dirt has hardened, remove it using mild soap and water, and then wipe the front window gently. Inex Technologies reserves the right to improve and enhance its product offerings.

The following accessories can be supplied by INEX/TECH. For documentation and part numbers, see Section 1. Table 2. Required Accessories Item Notes 24VDC power supply (voltage-adjustable) INEX/TECH model power supply. (If you use an external illuminator, it is recommended to use an illuminator power supply separate from the Camera System’s supply.) Mounting Hardware (pan-tilt-roll bracket) Typically on gantry or wall/pole; see the Mounting Hardware documentation for details (see Section 1). For documentation and part numbers, see Section 1. Prefabricated Power/Signals and LAN cables IZIO Digital I/O Controller External Illuminators An Allen wrench used to attach the mounting adapter plate to the housing (if applicable); size 3/16\" (4.76 mm) 8-wire cable for power/signals; recommended to use E119932-1/LL84201, 24 gauge (size of each wire); see Section 6.1. 2 mm flat screwdriver for tightening the screw terminals of the power/signals connector (see Section 6.1). 16 mm torque wrench for tightening the nuts of the power/signals connector, and for attaching the connector to the Camera System. Network (LAN) cabling (typically CAT 5e/6 cable) with metal-body RJ45 connectors. The total length of the cable should not exceed 328 feet (100 meters). See Section 6.2 for important LAN cable information. Tools for building LAN cables (wire stripper, crimp tool, etc.) and RJ45 connectors with metal bodies. For installations that require network cabling: typically use CAT 5e/6 cable. The total length of the cable should not exceed 328 feet (100 meters). All network cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded. You will need to provide a laptop computer to use for configuration. If you will be using the laptop outdoors, the screen must be able to be seen in strong sunlight. Required software: Windows 10 or above - with .NET 4.5 enabled in \"Windows Features\" Chrome or Microsoft Edge browser Your camera’s Field of View (FOV) is the area that the camera can \"see\". You can think of this area as an imaginary rectangle rising from the lane upwards. The width of this area is called the horizontal FOV or \"capture line\". See your camera’s User Guide for the horizontal and vertical FOV specifications. Figure 3. Field of View (Capture Line) Select your camera’s position so that license plates are always within the capture line and parallel to it, with the camera facing as straight at the plates as possible - as shown in the following diagrams: Figure 4. Plates Within Capture Line Figure 5. Plates Parallel to Capture Line - Away from Road Curves The maximum horizontal angle allowed is 30° (to the farthest point at the end of the capture line). The maximum vertical angle allowed is 30°. Installations that position the camera at significant angles in relation to the plates will reduce the line-of-sight distances specified. Figure 6. Horizontal Camera Angle (Pan Angle) Click to show notes for Horizontal Angle The maximum horizontal angle allowed is 30° (to the farthest point at the end of the capture line). If you must capture plates on a curve, place the camera on the side of the road that minimizes the horizontal angle. At larger angles, the reflectivity of the plates is reduced, resulting in images with less contrast. For plates whose characters are very shiny (for example, silvery), the weighted angle must be less than 20 degrees. The weighted angle is the angle between a line from the camera to the plate, and a line running straight ahead from the vehicle. Figure 7. Vertical Camera Angle (Tilt Angle) and Line-of-Sight Distance from Plate Click to show notes for Vertical Angle The distance from the camera to the capture line must be within the viewing range of the LPR camera. Adjust the vertical angle so that the camera can read plates at all of their expected heights from the road. The maximum vertical angle allowed is 30°. Larger angles and/or greater mounting heights may be required in order to recognize plates on vehicles close to each other (such as in slow/congested traffic). At larger angles, the reflectivity of the plates is reduced, resulting in images with less contrast. For plates whose characters are very shiny (for example, silvery), the weighted angle must be less than 20 degrees. The weighted angle is the angle between a line from the camera to the plate, and a line running straight ahead from the vehicle. The camera should not be positioned so that the rays of the sun behind the camera shine along the camera-to-plate axis. Reflective plates will cause severe glare to be reflected back to the camera, obscuring the image of the plate’s characters. Avoid/mitigate by: Not installing the camera in an east/west direction Installing the camera near a building that shields it from the sun’s rays Installing the camera on a short pole Using a double-camera installation (2 different angles or front/rear) Figure 8. Sun Behind Camera (on Same Axis as Line-of-Sight from Camera to Plate) External illuminators can be used to enhance overview vehicle image quality, for front and/or rear capture. It is recommended to use an illuminator power supply separate from the Camera System’s supply. Figure 9. External Illuminator The wavelength of an external illuminator must be compatible with the wavelength of the internal illuminators of the Inex Camera System. The Inex IZA800GORT Camera Systems are typically used with the IZS series strobe illuminators. By using the following guidelines, you can match the illuminator to your Inex Camera System. The number of illuminator LEDs and beam angle must match the distance type (long or short) of the Camera System being used, as follows: Fewer LEDs and wider beam angles are used for short distances More LEDs and narrower beam angles are used for longer distances The results of applying these guidelines can be found in the following table: Table 3. Camera-to-Illuminator Recommended Setups Camera Illuminator Strobe Signal Night Image Installation IZA800GORT-L-xx IZS2-WL-20 IZA800GORT2-CL-20 OV Strobe Color Rear IZA800GORT-L-xx IZS2-DR-20 IZS2-IR-20 LPR Strobe B/W Front IZA800GORT-S-xx IZS1-WL-30 IZS1-CL-30 OV Strobe Color Rear IZA800GORT-S-xx IZS1-DR-30 IZS1-IR-30 LPR Strobe B/W Front You can trigger an illuminator from the LPR or OV camera by using appropriate wiring (see Section 8). The pulse width and other parameters that affect illuminator operation are pre-configured according to your project’s requirements. See the illuminator guides for further details about installation and mounting considerations (see Section 1). Mount illuminators at an appropriate distance away from their associated Camera System(s) , according to the objectives of your project. Contact Inex for guidance/training about this subject. Position the illuminator so you can aim it at the place where vehicles pass for recognition - while minimizing the glare into drivers' eyes. In most cases, however, white illuminators are mounted to be aimed at the rear of vehicles. Illuminator aiming is most effective at night. You can look at an infrared-type illuminator with a smartphone camera to see if it is working. Table 4. Additional Installation Considerations Item Considerations Surge Protection On power, network and data cables Correct, Stable and Sufficient Power Power undervoltage, overvoltage and/or incorrect polarity will damage the unit and will void the warranty. Stable power at the correct level must be supplied to each Camera System, even when under a heavy processing load. Cable Extensions IMPORTANT All network cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded. Power - Use a cable gauge sufficient to deliver 24 VDC at the Camera System LAN - Use only CAT 5e/6 cable for any extensions added to the LAN cable. The total length of the cable should not exceed 328 feet (100 meters). In order to use the connector included with the Camera System, the outer diameter of the LAN cable must be in the range of 0.20\" to 0.25\" (5.0 to 6.5 mm). Front/Rear Capture - or Both Country requirements Vehicle types Protruding parts that obscure plates (such as rear hooks) Recessed plates Objects with character-like appearances (interpreted as characters on a plate, resulting in false reads) Avoid having these items in the Field of View: Fences with patterns Barriers Signs Obstructions (blocking FOV) Entry gates Trees and bushes (even before fully grown) Bright light (sun/artificial) shining directly into Camera System’s front window Weather - snow, heavy rain, dust storms Dirt on front window (see Section 13) Mounting Typically gantry (can also be on wall/pole) Additional construction if needed Prefabricated cables can be ordered from Inex. See Section 1 and Table 6. At the end of this procedure, you will need to check that there is conductivity from the shield wire (at the power supply end of the cable) to the body of the connector that will be connected to the Camera System. Use the cable type recommended in the Required Accessories section (see Section 4.2). Lay out the parts from the power connector package. Figure 10. Power/Signals Cable: Laying Out Connector Parts Thread the cable through the sealing nut and rubber seal. Figure 11. Power/Signals Cable: Threading Cable Through Sealing Nut and Rubber Seal Prepare the cable shielding: Thread the cable all the way through the clamp cage body. Strip off the outer insulation of the cable, leaving the individual insulated wires exposed to a length of 18mm. Be careful not to cut into the inner foil and plastic jackets (casings) surrounding the individual insulated wires. Slit the foil jacket, and bend it back onto the outer insulation. Carefully cut away the plastic jacket enclosing the individual insulated wires. Wrap the shield wire (the one without insulation) 1-2 times around the foil jacket that you bent back. Figure 12. Power/Signals Cable: Stripping Off the Outer Insulation Peel the backing off of the conductive foil to expose the adhesive. Figure 13. Power/Signals Cable: Peeling Backing off Conductive Foil Wrap the conductive foil around the point at which the outer insulation was stripped, to cover and make contact with the shield wire and foil jacket. Figure 14. Power/Signals Cable: Wrapping Conductive Foil Around Shield Wire and Jacket Strip off 5 mm from each individual wire. Insert each wire into its appropriate screw terminal, and tighten with a 2 mm flat screwdriver. The suggested wire colors and pinouts are shown in the following Figures. The notch between pins 1 and 2 on the face of the connector corresponds to the notch on the circular body of the screw terminals. Table 5. Power/Signals Cable Connector Pinout Pin Power/Signal Wire Color 1 24 VDC (-) / GND Black 2 LPR Strobe (+) Brown 3 OV Strobe (-) White 4 LPR Strobe (-) Blue 5 24 VDC (+) Red 6 RS485 (A) Orange 7 RS485 (B) Yellow 8 OV Strobe (+) Green Shield (Connector Body) --- Figure 15. Power/Signals Cable: Attaching the Wires to the Screw Terminals Insert the screw terminals body into the clamp cage housing. Note how the tabs on the screw terminals fit into the grooves in the clamp cage housing. Figure 16. Power/Signals Cable: Inserting Screw Terminals' Tabs into Clamp Cage Housing Verify that the conductive foil is now making contact with the spring sleeve protrusions inside the clamp cage housing. Use a 16 mm torque wrench to tighten the nut that fastens the clamp cage housing to the screw terminals body (torque 4-6 kgf.cm / 0.39-0.59 N.m.). Figure 17. Power/Signals Cable: Foil in Contact with Spring Inside Clamp Cage Housing Slide the sealing nut along the cable, and insert it in between the clamp cage protrusions. Figure 18. Power Cable: Inserting the Sealing Nut into the Clamp Cage Using a 16 mm wrench, tighten the nut that seals the end of the clamp cage housing. (torque 4-6 kgf.cm / 0.39-0.59 N.m.). Verify that the sealing nut is in tight contact with the inner body of the nut (to provide insulation against moisture). The sealing nut may pucker a bit due to the pressure of the nut; this is normal. Figure 19. Power Cable: Tightening the Nut to Seal the Clamp Cage The point in the cable at which you will be connecting the power wires (+, - and ground) to the power supply may be in the middle of the cable. (This part of the cable is typically inside a connection box to seal all connections from moisture.) Strip off a portion of outer insulation of the cable at the end you will be connecting to the power supply. Remove enough insulation so the shield wire will be long enough to wrap several times around the foil jacket (see next steps) and come out of the cable to reach the power supply ground wire. Be careful not to cut into the inner foil and plastic jackets (casings) surrounding the individual insulated wires. Slit the foil jacket, and bend it back onto the outer insulation. Leave enough foil exposed so the shield wire can be wrapped several times around the foil. Carefully cut away the plastic jacket enclosing the individual insulated wires. Wrap the shield wire (the one without insulation) several times around the foil jacket that you bent back. There must be a tight contact between the shield wire and the foil. Figure 20. Power Cable: Wrapping the Shield Wire at Power Supply End IMPORTANT: Check that there is conductivity from the shield wire (at the power supply end of the cable) to the body of the connector that will be connected to the camera. You can seal the shield wire wrapping on the cable with insulation tape or heat shrink tubing. Connect the shield wire to the ground wire of the power supply. You may need to extend the shield wire by soldering an additional wire on to it. Connect the (+) and (-) wires from the cable to the power supply. Figure 21. Power Cable: Connecting the Cable Wires to the Power Supply Connect the remaining signal wires (see Section 8). Prefabricated cables can be ordered from Inex. See Section 1 and Table 6. Click to show Important notes for LAN cable construction If you are building your own LAN cables, you must use RJ45 connectors with metal bodies. You must ensure that there is conductivity between the bodies of the connectors at each end of the cable. You can do this by extracting the cable’s shield wire before attaching the connector to the cable, and then soldering the shield wire to the body of the connector (see the following Figures). The outer diameter of the LAN cable must be in the range of 0.20\" to 0.25\" (5.0 to 6.5 mm). If you are using prefabricated CAT 5e/6 cables with metal-body RJ45 connectors, the shield wires have typically already been connected to each connector body. However, you must still check that there is conductivity between the bodies of the connectors at each end of the cable. Figure 22. LAN Cable: Extracting the Shield Wire Figure 23. LAN Cable: Shield Wire Soldered to Connector Body Lay out the parts from the network (LAN) connector package. Figure 24. LAN Cable: Connector Parts Slip the sealing nut over the RJ45 connector onto the LAN cable, with the inner threads in the direction of the RJ45 connector. Figure 25. LAN Cable: Slipping Sealing Nut Over RJ45 Connector Open the rubber sealing ring at its split, and put it on the cable. Figure 26. LAN Cable: Attaching Rubber Sealing Ring to Cable Orient the support plastic with the wider side (with the thinner walls) towards the RJ45 connector. Put the support plastic on the cable (the split can expand slightly). Figure 27. LAN Cable: Attaching the Support Plastic to the Cable Gently push the RJ45 connector into the housing until it fits snugly in the cutout in the housing. Figure 28. LAN Cable: Inserting RJ45 into Housing Cutout Insert the support plastic into the housing, followed by the rubber sealing ring. Seat the rubber sealing ring between the housing’s teeth as far in as it will go. Figure 29. LAN Cable: Inserting the Support Plastic and Rubber Ring into the Housing Tighten the sealing nut (torque 8-15 kgf.cm / 0.78-1.47 N.m.). Figure 30. LAN Cable: Completed Assembly Before mounting components, see Section 8 to ensure that your site plan accommodates how the components will be wired together. After mounting, remove the protective film from the front window of the Camera System. Secure the Camera System(s) and illuminator(s) to the appropriate mounting hardware (see the Mounting Hardware documentation - see Section 1). Mount other components (such as junction boxes) in appropriate locations. Here are typical wiring diagrams. See Table 5 for the power/signals cable wire colors, and Table 6 for a legend/bill of materials. Turn off/disconnect the external (AC) power supply before connecting cables. If you are using an Inex power supply, see its User Guide (see Section 1) for important information. The torques required to connect the cable connectors to the connectors on the Camera System are as follows: Power/signals cable: 3-4 kgf.cm / 0.29-0.39 N.m.; LAN cable: 5-8 kgf.cm / 0.49-0.78 N.m.

Power undervoltage, overvoltage and/or incorrect polarity will damage the unit and will void the warranty. Stable power at the correct level must be supplied to each Camera System, even when under a heavy processing load. Connect a plug to the Live (+V), Neutral (-V) and Ground (Shield) terminals of the power supply (see Section 8). Plug the power supply into the AC electricity. If required, switch the power supply unit ON. The Inex cameras have been pre-configured with default IP addresses. You will probably need to change these addresses to conform to the requirements of your network. Be sure that you have IP addresses reserved for all components of your ALPR system (RoadView computer and cameras). The IZ Discovery utility discovers all active devices connected to the network, and displays a list of their network parameters. These devices can include cameras and computers. See the IZ Discovery User Guide (see Section 1) for instructions on how to change a Camera System’s IP address. To view the camera’s home page (see Figure 34): Open a browser. Enter the IP address of the camera into the address field. Figure 34. Camera’s Home Page Select the function you need from the links at the upper left: Click the Live button to see what the camera is currently viewing. You can also use the zoom and focus controls. Click to show notes for Live View When using Live View for the first time, you may be prompted to download and install an ActiveX control (Smart Viewer). If you do not have an internet connection to the network on which the camera is installed, wait 30 seconds, and you will be instructed on how to install the ActiveX control locally via the camera’s firmware. The stream of the Live View can also be accessed using an RTSP URL with this format : rtsp://[username:password]@/cam0_0 where cam0_0 is a camera-specific parameter (which in this case enables you to access the primary stream) To see the stream, use a video player such as the VLC player, located at: VLC If you need to change the camera’s IP address or other configuration parameters, click the Admin button. When prompted for a login, use the Administrator username/password credentials of root, IZpass12. The Administrator user name (root) cannot be changed, and the Administrator password is encrypted. Therefore, if someone changes the Administrator password, there is no way to find out the password if it gets lost. It is highly recommended to use a fixed IP address (not DHCP). A fixed IP address enables you to access the camera using the same URL every time, even after unexpected power outages. You can also use IZ Discovery to change the camera’s IP address (see Section 1). In the Network group, click on IP Address: Figure 35. Changing the Camera’s IP Address To change the IP address to a fixed one: The IP address must be unique within the entire ALPR system, and must be within the limits of standard IPv4 address numbering. Click the Static radio button. Enter the network address parameters. All cameras must be on the same subnet as both the computer you will use to communicate with and configure the camera, and the Inex RoadView computer. It is highly recommended to record the camera’s IP address and port number in a safe place. You will need them if the camera’s parameters are reset back to their defaults, and for configuring Inex recognition software. Click Apply. After selecting Apply, you will be requested to close your web browser so the updates can take effect. This will take 20 seconds or more, to allow the camera time to reboot. - If you click the browser’s Back button, all values will be discarded. - If you click the browser’s Refresh button, the application will load the previous values. In the IZ Discovery utility (see the IZ Discovery User Guide - see Section 1), click the \"Clear List\" button, and verify that the camera can be recognized with the new IP address. Camera settings are typically set by Inex. Close all windows, and the browser window. There are two cameras in the Camera System. Both are calibrated in nearly the same way. The LPR camera is set to capture in black and white, and the Overview (OV) camera is set to capture in color. The OV camera can be used both to display an overview image, and to perform LPR recognition. You may even be able to improve read accuracy by changing the zoom to have one camera \"see\" closer than the other one. Move a vehicle next to, and at the middle of the capture line. (This is the position at which the vehicle sensor signals that the vehicle is present.) Ensure that the Camera System is aimed at the middle of the lane, and is at the required capture distance (see Section 5 and the IZA800GORT User Guide - see Section 1). Alternatively, in a lab, position a license plate at the expected distance and height. See the IZ Discovery User Guide (see Section 1). Open a browser (Chrome or Microsoft Edge). Type in the IP address of the RoadView computer. For example: 192.168.5.110 You will see the login screen. Enter the default username and password (root, root): Figure 36. Logging In to RoadView You should see the RoadView Live (Journal) tab. See the RoadView ALPR User Guide for instructions for configuring and using RoadView (see Section 1). See the RoadView ALPR User Guide (see Section 1) for logout instructions, using the multi-line dropdown menu icon in the upper right corner of the screen. See the RoadView ALPR User Guide (see Section 1) for calibration instructions. Using a license plate mounted in a lab, or by driving a vehicle through the lane, verify that an Event is generated with the correct plate read (recorded in the RoadView Live (Journal) tab - see the RoadView ALPR User Guide). See Section 1. Once the lane is active, verify that Events are being generated for each vehicle passing each camera, and that the recognition has sufficient accuracy and confidence. See the RoadView ALPR User Guide (see Section 1). It is recommended to check all mounting screws for proper tightness once every two years. Do not use solvents or strong abrasive detergent when cleaning the Camera System. Use a soft dry cloth to clean the ALPR Camera System’s front glass when it is dirty. If the dirt has hardened, remove it using mild soap and water, and then wipe the front window gently. Inex Technologies reserves the right to improve and enhance its product offerings.

Required Accessories Item Notes 24VDC power supply (voltage-adjustable) INEX/TECH model power supply. (If you use an external illuminator, it is recommended to use an illuminator power supply separate from the Camera System’s supply.) Mounting Hardware (pan-tilt-roll bracket) Typically on gantry or wall/pole; see the Mounting Hardware documentation for details Power/LAN cable Connects the Camera System to power and LAN; IZ Composite Cable or Power/LAN Cable for VES System DIN Rail Mount Connection Panel Used to connect the Camera System to the LAN and power supply When using Inex cables (such as the IZ Composite Cable or the prefabricated Power/LAN Cable), for proper LAN connectivity from the Camera System via the IZPanel (see Section 8.2), the maximum cable length is 200 feet. For documentation and part numbers, see Section 1. External Illuminators Prefabricated camera-to-illuminator cables 0.1 in (2.5 mm) flat screwdriver for tightening the screw terminals of the Power/LAN connector (see Section 6.1) and 0.08 in (2 mm) flat screwdriver for tightening the screw terminal blocks of the IZPanel. Network (LAN) cabling (typically CAT 5e/6 cable) with metal-body RJ45 connectors. The total length of the cable should not exceed 328 feet (100 meters). Tools for building cables (wire stripper, crimp tool, etc.) For installations that require network cabling: typically use CAT 5e/6 cable. The total length of the cable should not exceed 328 feet (100 meters). All network cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded. You will need to provide a laptop computer to use for configuration. If you will be using the laptop outdoors, the screen must be able to be seen in strong sunlight. Required software: Windows 10 or above - with .NET 4.5 enabled in \"Windows Features\" Chrome or Microsoft Edge browser Your camera’s Field of View (FOV) is the area that the camera can \"see\". You can think of this area as an imaginary rectangle rising from the lane upwards. The width of this area is called the horizontal FOV or \"capture line\". See your camera’s User Guide for the horizontal and vertical FOV specifications. Figure 2. Field of View (Capture Line) Select your camera’s position so that license plates are always within the capture line and parallel to it, with the camera facing as straight at the plates as possible - as shown in the following diagrams: Figure 3. Plates Within Capture Line Figure 4. Plates Parallel to Capture Line - Away from Road Curves The maximum horizontal angle allowed is 30° (to the farthest point at the end of the capture line). The maximum vertical angle allowed is 30°. Installations that position the camera at significant angles in relation to the plates will reduce the line-of-sight distances specified. Figure 5. Horizontal Camera Angle (Pan Angle) Click to show notes for Horizontal Angle The maximum horizontal angle allowed is 30° (to the farthest point at the end of the capture line). If you must capture plates on a curve, place the camera on the side of the road that minimizes the horizontal angle. At larger angles, the reflectivity of the plates is reduced, resulting in images with less contrast. For plates whose characters are very shiny (for example, silvery), the weighted angle must be less than 20 degrees. The weighted angle is the angle between a line from the camera to the plate, and a line running straight ahead from the vehicle. Figure 6. Vertical Camera Angle (Tilt Angle) and Line-of-Sight Distance from Plate Click to show notes for Vertical Angle The distance from the camera to the capture line must be within the viewing range of the LPR camera. Adjust the vertical angle so that the camera can read plates at all of their expected heights from the road. The maximum vertical angle allowed is 30°. Larger angles and/or greater mounting heights may be required in order to recognize plates on vehicles close to each other (such as in slow/congested traffic). At larger angles, the reflectivity of the plates is reduced, resulting in images with less contrast. For plates whose characters are very shiny (for example, silvery), the weighted angle must be less than 20 degrees. The weighted angle is the angle between a line from the camera to the plate, and a line running straight ahead from the vehicle. The camera should not be positioned so that the rays of the sun behind the camera shine along the camera-to-plate axis. Reflective plates will cause severe glare to be reflected back to the camera, obscuring the image of the plate’s characters. Avoid/mitigate by: Not installing the camera in an east/west direction Installing the camera near a building that shields it from the sun’s rays Installing the camera on a short pole Using a double-camera installation (2 different angles or front/rear) Figure 7. Sun Behind Camera (on Same Axis as Line-of-Sight from Camera to Plate) Figure 8. External Illuminator The wavelength of an external illuminator must be compatible with the wavelength of the internal illuminators of the Inex Camera System. The Inex IZA800GVES Camera Systems are typically used with the IZSVES series strobe illuminators. By using the following guidelines, you can match the illuminator to your Inex Camera System. The number of illuminator LEDs and beam angle must match the distance type (long or short) of the Camera System being used, as follows: Fewer LEDs and wider beam angles are used for short distances More LEDs and narrower beam angles are used for longer distances The results of applying these guidelines can be found in the following table: Table 3. Camera-to-Illuminator Recommended Setups Camera Illuminator Strobe Signal Night Image Installation IZA800GVES-L-xx IZSVES2-WL-20 OV Strobe Color Rear IZA800GVES-S-xx IZSVES1-WL-H40 IZA800GVES-L-xx IZSVES2-IR-20 OV Strobe B/W Front IZA800GVES-S-xx IZSVES1-IR-H40 You can trigger an illuminator from the OV camera by using appropriate cabling - see Section 8.1 and the IZSVES Strobe Illuminator Series User Guide (see Section 1). The pulse width and other parameters that affect illuminator operation are pre-configured according to your project’s requirements. See the illuminator guides for further details about installation and mounting considerations (see Section 1). Mount illuminators at an appropriate distance away from their associated Camera System(s) , according to the objectives of your project. Contact Inex for guidance/training about this subject. Position the illuminator so you can aim it at the place where vehicles pass for recognition - while minimizing the glare into drivers' eyes. In most cases, however, white illuminators are mounted to be aimed at the rear of vehicles. Illuminator aiming is most effective at night. You can look at an infrared-type illuminator with a smartphone camera to see if it is working. Table 4. Additional Installation Considerations Item Considerations Surge Protection On power, network and data cables Correct, Stable and Sufficient Power Power undervoltage, overvoltage and/or incorrect polarity will damage the unit and will void the warranty. Stable power at the correct level must be supplied to each Camera System, even when under a heavy processing load. Cable Extensions IMPORTANT All network cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded. Power - Use a cable gauge sufficient to deliver 24 VDC at the Camera System LAN - When using Inex cables (such as the IZ Composite Cable or the prefabricated Power/LAN Cable) for LAN connectivity from the Camera System via the IZPanel, the maximum cable length is 200 feet. In order to use the connector included with the Camera System, you must use the IZ Composite Cable to ensure the outer diameter of the cable will fit in the connector. Front/Rear Capture - or Both Country requirements Vehicle types Protruding parts that obscure plates (such as rear hooks) Recessed plates Objects with character-like appearances (interpreted as characters on a plate, resulting in false reads) Avoid having these items in the Field of View: Fences with patterns Barriers Signs Obstructions (blocking FOV) Entry gates Trees and bushes (even before fully grown) Bright light (sun/artificial) shining directly into Camera System’s front window Weather - snow, heavy rain, dust storms Dirt on front window (see Section 13) Mounting Typically gantry (can also be on wall/pole) Additional construction if needed The IZ Composite or prefabricated Power/LAN cables are custom-made for VES camera applications. If you have an IZ Composite Cable, you will need to connect one end to the connector plug supplied with the IZA800GVES Camera System (see Section 6.2). If you have a prefabricated Power/LAN cable, the connector plug is already attached to one end. The other end of the cable consists of flying leads that will need to be connected to the IZPanel terminal block connections (see Section 8.2) Refer to Figure 9 when following the instructions in this section. Since you will need access to the Power/LAN panel connector on the Camera System to perform this procedure, you should follow these instructions before mounting the camera. Figure 9. Female Connector Plug Assembly Measure the length of IZ Composite Cable you will need. Be sure to allow extra length for the parts of the cable that have to: Pass through the connector Go around bends Reach far enough to reach terminals in a connection box, if applicable The maximum cable length for proper LAN connectivity via an IZPanel is 200 feet (61 m) At the end of this procedure, you will need to check that there is conductivity from the drain (shield) wire (at the power supply end of the cable) to the drain wire connected to the connector plug. Unscrew and separate all of the Power/LAN connector plug parts, including the \"female insert\" part that exposes the screw terminals inside the plug (see Figure 9). If the parts are connected together, you can separate the insert as follows: Attach the connector plug to a male panel connector (either on the Camera System, or an IZSVES illuminator). Be sure the notch on the plug lines up with the protrusion on the panel connector. Tighten the outer insert ring onto the panel connector to fix it in place. Unscrew the outer sleeve ring from the hood. Match the bevels inside the hood to the bevels of the sleeve. Loosen the sleeve with a series of partial turns (so the wires won’t get twisted inside the hood): Small turn Remove hood from sleeve Rotate hood back to original position Replace hood on sleeve Make another small turn When the sleeve is loose enough, you can loosen it the rest of the way by rotating the sleeve’s bevels. Release the outer insert ring and remove the plug from the connector Thread the cable through the pressing screw, pinch ring, and \"seal\" ring. Figure 10. Threading the Cable Through the Screw, Ring and Seal Thread the cable into the bottom of the hood and out though the top of the hood. Continue threading the cable through the sleeve. Figure 11. Threading the Cable Through the Hood and Sleeve If needed, turn the inner part of the insert to the desired position. This is typically done with the notch towards the \"bottom\" (in the same direction as the bottom of the hood). This typical position will enable the cables to leave the connector plug directly towards the back of the Camera System. If you attach an illuminator cable, secure or remove the connector’s protective cap to prevent it from falling (safety hazard). Figure 12. Connector Plugs with Cables Attached to Camera Strip off the outer rubber insulation of the cable, leaving the individual insulated wires at a length of 0.8-1.0 in (20-25 mm). There should be enough length in the wires to enable turning the hood to a different position (see Figure 14). Be careful not to cut into the shield mesh surrounding the inside of the cable, the drain wire strands, and the plastic jackets (casings) surrounding the individual insulated wires. Pull the shield mesh and plastic jacket back along the cable to expose the drain wire. The drain wire is the same color as the shield mesh, and is composed of several strands wound together. Figure 13. Locating the Drain Wire Carefully cut away a small amount of the jackets enclosing pairs of the individual insulated wires. Separate the wires. Strip off 0.2 in (5 mm) from each insulated wire (lead). Insert each flying lead (stripped wires and drain wire) into the appropriate screw terminal, and tighten the terminal’s screw with a 0.1 in (2.5 mm) flat screwdriver. The wire colors and pinouts are shown in the following Figure (see Table 5). You can see small pin numbers near each screw terminal (see Figure 14). The screw terminal for the drain wire is in the middle of the insert, with the screw threaded up from the bottom (see Figure 15). All wire colors are those used in the IZ_COMPOSITE_CABLE and IZCAB-AVES cables. Table 5. Building the Power/LAN Cable with IZ_COMPOSITE_CABLE Pin Power/LAN Wire Color 1 GND Black 2 +V (24 VDC) Red 3 LAN TX (+) White/Orange 4 LAN TX (-) Orange 5 LAN TX (+) White/Green 6 LAN RX (-) Green Drain (middle terminal) Silver Figure 14. Pin Numbers Near Screw Terminals Figure 15. Screw Terminals for Drain and Power/LAN Connections Verify that there is conductivity from the drain wire (at the end of the cable with the flying leads) to the drain pin on the connector plug. Attach the connector plug to a male panel connector (either on the Camera System, or an IZSVES illuminator). Be sure the notch on the plug lines up with the protrusion on the panel connector. Tighten the outer insert ring onto the panel connector to fix it in place. Hold the sleeve bevels and being to tighten the sleeve onto the insert When you can no longer tighten the sleeve with your fingers, continue a small additional tightening using the bevels to make partial turns, as described in the following steps (so the wires won’t get twisted inside the hood): Be sure to tighten the sleeve just enough to feel a little resistance. This will enable the connector plug to be rotated more once it is connected to the Camera System (see Figure 12). Match the bevels inside the hood to the bevels of the sleeve. Make a small turn Remove the hood from the sleeve Rotate the hood back to its original position Replace the hood on the sleeve Make another small turn Once you have finished tightening the sleeve, turn the hood to the desired angle which for which you want the cable to leave the Camera System (see Figure 12). Slide the hood along the cable towards the terminal connections by pulling the cable out the bottom of the hood. Leave a small amount space between the hood and the sleeve - this will enable you to loosen/adjust the sleeve in the future (by moving the hood away to make partial turns). The sleeve ring’s threads (inside the ring facing the bevels) attach the sleeve to the hood’s threads; use the sleeve’s ring to tighten the attachment. Slide the seal, pinch ring and pressing screw nut along the cable. Push the seal all the way up into the hood. Figure 16. Power/LAN Cable: Pushing the Seal into the Hood Slide the pinch ring into the bottom of the hood. Tighten the pressing screw to push the other parts up into the hood. Maximum recommended torque is 10.2 kgf.cm / 1.0 N.m. up to 12.7 kgf.cm / 1.25 N.m. If you have built the Power/LAN Cable using the IZ_COMPOSITE_CABLE, or if you need to remove more insulation from the flying leads of the IZCAB-AVES Power/LAN cable, follow these instructions: Strip off the outer rubber insulation of the cable, leaving the individual insulated wires at an appropriate length for connection to the IZPanel (see Section 8.2). Be careful not to cut into the shield mesh surrounding the inside of the cable, the drain wire strands, and the plastic jackets (casings) surrounding the individual insulated wires. Pull the shield mesh and plastic jacket back along the cable to expose the drain wire. The drain wire is the same color as the shield mesh, and is composed of several strands wound together (see Figure 13). Carefully cut away an appropriate amount from the jackets enclosing pairs of the individual insulated wires. Separate the wires. Strip off 0.2 in (5 mm) from each insulated wire (lead). Before mounting components, see Section 8 to ensure that your site plan accommodates how the components will be wired together. After mounting, remove the protective film from the front window of the Camera System. Secure the Camera System(s) and illuminator(s) to the appropriate mounting hardware (see the Mounting Hardware documentation - see Section 1). Mount other components (such as junction boxes) in appropriate locations. See Table 5 for the power/LAN cable wire colors. See Table 6 for a legend/bill of materials. See Section 8.2 for instructions on how to connect system components to the IZPanel. Turn off/disconnect the external (AC) power supply before connecting cables. If you are using an Inex power supply, see its User Guide (see Section 1) for important information. When using Inex cables (such as the IZ Composite Cable) for LAN connectivity from the Camera System via the IZPanel, the maximum cable length is 200 ft (61 m). If you attach an illuminator cable, secure or remove the connector’s protective cap to prevent it from falling (safety hazard). To attach the cables, tighten the outer insert ring onto the corresponding panel connector (see Figure 9). After connecting the cables, you can still rotate them slightly to achieve the desired angle (see Figure 12). If you need a bigger rotation, see Section 6.2. Figure 17.

It provides a convenient way to connect the Power/LAN cable from the IZA800GVES Camera System to the LAN and power supply (see the IZPanel documentation referred to in Section 1). See Section 8.1 for typical wiring diagrams. Power undervoltage, overvoltage and/or incorrect polarity will damage the unit and will void the warranty. Stable power at the correct level must be supplied to the Camera System, even when under a heavy processing load. Turn off/disconnect the external (AC) power supply before connecting cables. If you are using an Inex power supply, see its User Guide (see Section 1) for important information. All network cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded. The screw terminal blocks of the IZPanel are plugs. They can be removed for more convenient access when attaching flying leads (wires). Use a 0.08 in (2 mm) flat screwdriver to tighten the terminal screws. Power - With the power supply OFF: Connect the power supply’s (V+), GND and drain terminals to the appropriate connections on the IZPanel’s smaller terminal block. Connect the camera Power/LAN cable’s flying leads (wires) of red (+), black (-) and drain to the IZPanel’s larger terminal block. LAN Connect the LAN TX +/- and RX +/- leads to the appropriate connections on the IZPanel’s larger terminal block. Connect your network switch to the RJ45 connector on the IZPanel. If any power cables were lengthened, ensure that all components receive exactly their rated voltage. Power undervoltage, overvoltage and/or incorrect polarity will damage the unit and will void the warranty. Stable power at the correct level must be supplied to each Camera System, even when under a heavy processing load. Connect a plug to the Live (+V), Neutral (-V) and Ground (Shield) terminals of the power supply (see Section 8.1). Plug the power supply into the AC electricity. If required, switch the power supply unit ON. The Inex cameras have been pre-configured with default IP addresses. You will probably need to change these addresses to conform to the requirements of your network. Be sure that you have IP addresses reserved for all components of your system (RoadView computer and cameras). The IZ Discovery utility discovers all active devices connected to the network, and displays a list of their network parameters. These devices can include cameras and computers. See the IZ Discovery User Guide (see Section 1) for instructions on how to change a Camera System’s IP address. To view the camera’s home page (see Figure 19): Open a browser. Enter the IP address of the camera into the address field. Figure 19. Camera’s Home Page Select the function you need from the links at the upper left: Click the Live button to see what the camera is currently viewing. You can also use the zoom and focus controls. Click to show notes for Live View When using Live View for the first time, you may be prompted to download and install an ActiveX control (Smart Viewer). If you do not have an internet connection to the network on which the camera is installed, wait 30 seconds, and you will be instructed on how to install the ActiveX control locally via the camera’s firmware. The stream of the Live View can also be accessed using an RTSP URL with this format : rtsp://[username:password]@/cam0_0 where cam0_0 is a camera-specific parameter (which in this case enables you to access the primary stream) To see the stream, use a video player such as the VLC player, located at: VLC If you need to change the camera’s IP address or other configuration parameters, click the Admin button. When prompted for a login, use the Administrator username/password credentials of root, IZpass12. The Administrator user name (root) cannot be changed, and the Administrator password is encrypted. Therefore, if someone changes the Administrator password, there is no way to find out the password if it gets lost. It is highly recommended to use a fixed IP address (not DHCP). A fixed IP address enables you to access the camera using the same URL every time, even after unexpected power outages. You can also use IZ Discovery to change the camera’s IP address (see Section 1). In the Network group, click on IP Address: Figure 20. Changing the Camera’s IP Address To change the IP address to a fixed one: The IP address must be unique within the entire VES system, and must be within the limits of standard IPv4 address numbering. Click the Static radio button. Enter the network address parameters. All cameras must be on the same subnet as both the computer you will use to communicate with and configure the camera, and the Inex RoadView computer. It is highly recommended to record the camera’s IP address and port number in a safe place. You will need them if the camera’s parameters are reset back to their defaults, and for configuring Inex recognition software. Click Apply. After selecting Apply, you will be requested to close your web browser so the updates can take effect. This will take 20 seconds or more, to allow the camera time to reboot. - If you click the browser’s Back button, all values will be discarded. - If you click the browser’s Refresh button, the application will load the previous values. In the IZ Discovery utility (see the IZ Discovery User Guide - see Section 1), click the \"Clear List\" button, and verify that the camera can be recognized with the new IP address. Camera settings are typically set by Inex. Close all windows, and the browser window. There are two cameras in the Camera System. Both are calibrated in nearly the same way. The LPR camera is set to capture in black and white, and the Overview (OV) camera is set to capture in color. The OV camera can be used both to display an overview image, and to perform LPR recognition. You may even be able to improve read accuracy by changing the zoom to have one camera \"see\" closer than the other one. Move a vehicle next to, and at the middle of the capture line. (This is the position at which the vehicle sensor signals that the vehicle is present.) Ensure that the Camera System is aimed at the middle of the lane, and is at the required capture distance (see Section 5 and the IZA800GVES User Guide - see Section 1). Alternatively, in a lab, position a license plate at the expected distance and height. See the IZ Discovery User Guide (see Section 1). Open a browser (Chrome or Microsoft Edge). Type in the IP address of the RoadView computer. For example: 192.168.5.110 You will see the login screen. Enter the default username and password (root, root): Figure 21. Logging In to RoadView You should see the RoadView Live (Journal) tab. See the RoadView ALPR User Guide for instructions for configuring and using RoadView (see Section 1). See the RoadView ALPR User Guide (see Section 1) for logout instructions, using the multi-line dropdown menu icon in the upper right corner of the screen. See the RoadView ALPR User Guide (see Section 1) for calibration instructions. Using a license plate mounted in a lab, or by driving a vehicle through the lane, verify that an Event is generated with the correct plate read (recorded in the RoadView Live (Journal) tab - see the RoadView ALPR User Guide). See Section 1. Once the lane is active, verify that Events are being generated for each vehicle passing each Camera System, and that the recognition has sufficient accuracy and confidence. See the RoadView ALPR User Guide (see Section 1). It is recommended to check all mounting screws for proper tightness once every two years. Do not use solvents or strong abrasive detergent when cleaning the Camera System. Use a soft dry cloth to clean the VES Camera System’s front glass when it is dirty. If the dirt has hardened, remove it using mild soap and water, and then wipe the front window gently. Inex Technologies reserves the right to improve and enhance its product offerings.

If you have any questions, please contact our support team via our Inex Technologies Website. Click to show the Glossary Table 2. Glossary Term Explanation ALPR Automatic License Plate Recognition IZ ALPR system An Automatic License Plate Recognition system utilizing cameras and IZCloud software. The IZ ALPR system can capture LPR Events, and transmit them to other systems such as IZCentral. LPR Event The identified occurrence of a passing vehicle by the IZ ALPR System. An LPR Event includes metadata (location, lane identifiers, timestamp, the identified license plate number, recognition confidence, and more), plus a set of related images; typically, an Overview image, an LPR camera image and an image of the license plate. Also called a Vehicle Event or Event. An Event may include images from more than one camera in the same Lane. Rule can be enabled when editing a reservation can set the car limit If more than car limit is attempted, cars over limit cannot come in; but after 72 hrs (to make sure we didn’t miss a car leaving)or one of the car leaves then an additional car can enter. /{add a note that customer will have a custom site URL and will get username and password from INEX} Blue background means it was matched to a reservation. Click on the LP images to get all images captured at that time click on man item at right to add to a list How to search for a plate or a name put in a letter which becomes a wildcard for that letter in any position of the plate characters You can ask INEX to add different columns such as the name of the vehicle owner, etc. Date: Click on date range to get a date popup click on initial date, then on final date. Check box to enable filter. Enable refresh - disable if you have a lot of events, and you are trying to find one/filter Filter by Gate - use dropdown. Event Type or Type will not be on most users, shows what list car was on. Matched Plate - shows a match to a plate on a list Plate Read and Matched Plate can be 2 characters off Grant - Allowed in, gate opened Deny - Access denied, gate not opened There will be more actions in the future. Plates should not be on multiple lists but if they are, only one list will show in the EventType column, and the \"man\" icon will not be shown since plate is on a list. There is an option INEX can add - Name of owner Export to Excel button - be sure to select and check a time range of a week or less, export will also take all filters into account (such as only Vendors) Alarms will display all vehicles that attempted entry that are not on a list. When such a vehicle comes in there will be a popup anywhere on the site, and user will have to go to the Alarm screen to see a list of all of them. /{get screen shot from Erick} Alarms will be disabled by default - ask INEX if you want them Coordinate with Inex support to set up access to your site’s cameras to enable a live video feed on this Gates page. Correct Plate Read: Enables correction of LPR read of the last vehicle that passed through the gate Emergency Open: Press button, get are you sure, then gate opens; for ambulance, police etc. Add to List: only active if plate is not already on a list Add to Reservation: enables manually adding car to an imported reservation. Comes from a campground reservation site. demo site does not have this menu item but it will be there. Call or email the Inex support team Watch Lists is a list of all the lists. A list can be created to NOT open the gate, but still have the plates on that list appear in the Events. List could also be one for which Alerts will popup (or only for an unknown vehicle as it is on only one site now.) Multiple plates can be separated by commas Lists are of main people Sub-lists are tied to one particular person, such as guests for a resident /{Not all buttons in the GUI have tooltips; furthermore, some say edit OWNER/delete OWNER - Why was the term OWNER used?} /{The manage visitors button doesn’t work it throws an error} /{What does the \"send activation email\" check box do in the import dialog; why is the dialog called ListPlateOwnerImportSettings? This gives the impression I am importing the owner of the list, not the owners of the vehicles} /{The import/export button has no export - only import, and a link to an Excel template for importing visitors} /{fields not shown in the screen shot are: UserName, Email Address, Password, Should Change Password {means what?} (True/False), Active (True/False)} Via the export button from the Events screen /{need this - it was suggested by Pinchas? or just refer to Troubleshooting section?} /{Clicking on the letter of the login name at the upper right opens a menu to help manage the user’s account. My Settings (or clicking the person icon on the banner) enables you to change the user name; however if you select Change Password and cancel, the application will crash; F5 to refresh seems to recover} Note that the maintenance screen is good for seeing if the DPU is online It does not indicate anything about if the camera is online, or health of the camera (we are using IZ600Fs with DPUs) Review Results in dropdown at side of camera entry should show all of the events seen by that camera but it is not working.

Contact Inex Technologies to schedule training. If you have any questions, please contact our support team via our Inex Technologies Website. The IZ Discovery utility discovers all active devices connected to the network, and displays a list of their network parameters. These devices can include cameras and computers. If any device on your network is connected via wireless, IZ Discovery will not recognize the device. In addition, if the computer running IZ Discovery is connected via wireless, you will not see any devices displayed. Download the IZ Discovery software (see Section 1) Run IZ Discovery When IZ Discovery first runs, you may see a Windows security warning. If so, click Run. If you see a message related to the Windows firewall, click Allow. IZ Discovery will start and display a list of devices on the network, according to their serial numbers (see Figure 1). Scroll down to find the device you are interested in. You can double-click to view/edit a specific device’s IP address parameters (see Section 4). Click Clear List to refresh the discovery process. Figure 1. IZ Discovery Utility If IZ Discovery does not recognize a device: Press the device’s reset button (if available) Reset the device by shutting off power/removing the LAN cable, waiting 5 seconds, and reapplying power Check the LAN cable between your laptop and the network, and the LAN cable between the device and the LAN switch. Replace the cable(s) and run IZ Discovery again. Figure 2. Changing the Device’s Network Settings It is highly recommended to use a fixed IP address (not DHCP). A fixed IP address enables you to access the computer using the same URL every time, even after unexpected power outages. A dynamic IP address may change upon device reboot. Before opening the web interface, you will have to find the current IP address of the device using IZ Discovery. If you want to copy the IP address (for login to the device) you will need to uncheck the DHCP checkbox momentarily to make the address field accessible. For devices using RoadView software, you can change the IP address using the RoadView Settings tab (see Section 1). If your device is an Inex Camera System, be sure to define IP addresses for each camera (LPR and Overview), using each camera’s configuration application. It is recommended to use sequential IP addresses for the Camera System and its cameras; for example: 192.168.5.110, 192.168.5.111, 192.168.5.112 To change the device’s mode (fixed or dynamic [DHCP]), or IP address: Select the relevant line in the list of devices and double-click on it. The Network Settings window appears To change the mode: Check or uncheck the DHCP box Click Save To change the IP address: Verify that the address is not used by any other device on the network Be sure to uncheck the DHCP box Enter the network address parameters Write down the new IP Address and click Save The change should be reflected in the main dialog. This can take about a minute until the IP is obtained. If you do not see the change after this time, close IZ Discovery, and then reopen it. Verify that the IP address parameters have been changed to the ones you wanted. If not, you will have to log into the device (or RoadView) and change the IP address.

Installation Considerations Item Considerations Surge Protection You must use a network surge protector/arrestor on all power, network and data cables Correct, Stable and Sufficient Power Power undervoltage, overvoltage and/or incorrect polarity will damage the unit and will void the warranty. Stable power at the correct level must be supplied to each camera and IZIDPUG, even when under a heavy processing load. Cable Extensions IMPORTANT All network cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded. LAN - Use only CAT 5e/6 cable for any extensions added to the LAN cable. The total length of the cable should not exceed 328 feet (100 meters). Camera Configuration and Mounting Refer to the relevant installation and configuration documentation for your camera(s). The cameras should be configured, mounted and connected to the LAN before mounting and configuring the IZIDPUG. Click to show Important notes for LAN cable construction If you are building your own LAN cables, you must use RJ45 connectors with metal bodies. You must ensure that there is conductivity between the bodies of the connectors at each end of the cable. You can do this by extracting the cable’s shield wire before attaching the connector to the cable, and then soldering the shield wire to the body of the connector (see the following Figures). If you are using prefabricated CAT 5e/6 cables with metal-body RJ45 connectors, the shield wires have typically already been connected to each connector body. However, you must still check that there is conductivity between the bodies of the connectors at each end of the cable. Figure 6. LAN Cable: Extracting the Shield Wire Figure 7. LAN Cable: Shield Wire Soldered to Connector Body Power undervoltage, overvoltage and/or incorrect polarity will damage the unit and will void the warranty. Turn off/disconnect the any external (AC) power supplies before connecting cables. All network cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded. Figure 8. Typical Wiring Diagram for Access Control Events can be sent to IZCentral using the Inex HTTP API. Events can be sent to 3rd party systems using the Inex HTTP API and/or the Inex ZAP Protocol (see the RoadView ALPR User Guide for configuration details). See Section 1. The IZIDPUG and cameras have been pre-configured with default IP addresses. You will probably need to change these addresses to conform to the requirements of your network. Be sure that you have IP addresses reserved for all components of your ALPR system (IZIDPUG and cameras). If any power cables were lengthened, ensure that all components receive exactly their rated voltage. Power undervoltage, overvoltage and/or incorrect polarity will damage the unit and will void the warranty. Stable power at the correct level must be supplied to each component, even when under a heavy processing load. Connect the AC power to the IZIDPUG’s power supply Plug the barrel connector into the IZIDPUG Press the POWER button on the front panel Verify that the IZIDPUG has started to operate properly (see Section 8.3) With power applied, you should see that: The Power and Status LEDs on the back panel light up (see Section 4.6.3) The LAN connector LEDs on the left panel light/flash to indicate network activity (see Section 4.6.2) If the LEDs do not light as expected check if: The cable(s) are carrying power all the way to reach the unit. The LAN cable is connected properly to the unit. The IZ Discovery utility discovers all active devices connected to the network, and displays a list of their network parameters. These devices can include cameras and computers. See the IZ Discovery User Guide (see Section 1) for instructions on how to change the unit’s IP address. Open a browser (Chrome or Microsoft Edge). Type in the IP address of the IZIDPUG. For example: 192.168.5.110 You will see the login screen. Enter the default username and password (root, root): Figure 9. Logging In to RoadView You should see the RoadView Live (Journal) tab. See the RoadView ALPR User Guide for instructions for configuring and using RoadView (see Section 1). See the RoadView ALPR User Guide (see Section 1) for logout instructions, using the multi-line dropdown menu icon in the upper right corner of the screen. Using a license plate mounted in a lab, or by driving a vehicle through the lane, verify that an Event is generated with the correct plate read (recorded in the RoadView Live (Journal) tab - see the RoadView ALPR User Guide). See Section 1. Once the lane is active, verify that Events are being generated for each vehicle passing each camera, and that the recognition has sufficient accuracy and confidence.

See the Mounting Hardware documentation for a list of required tools (see Section 1). The following accessories can be supplied by INEX/TECH: Table 3. Required Accessories Inex Can Supply Item Notes 12 VDC or 24 VDC power supply (voltage-adjustable) INEX/TECH IZPWR 12 or 24 VDC power supply models. It is recommended to use an illuminator power supply separate from the Camera System’s supply. The wavelength of an external illuminator must be compatible with the wavelength of the internal illuminators of the Inex camera. The number of illuminator LEDs and beam angle must match the distance rating of the camera being used, as follows: Fewer LEDs and wider beam angles are used for short distances More LEDs and narrower beam angles are used for longer distances See your camera’s Installation Guide for a table of Camera-to-Illuminator Recommended Setups. Table 4. Additional Installation Considerations Item Considerations Surge Protection On power, network and data cables Cable Extensions IMPORTANT All network cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded. Power/Signals - Use type: Map UL2517; suggested manufacturer: TA YU; specification 24AWG x 6C + 16AWG x 2C + Mylar Be sure you can deliver 12 VDC or 24 VDC at the illuminator, even after all of the extensions have been added. It is recommended to use an illuminator power supply separate from the camera’s supply. Mounting Typically on gantry Additional construction may be needed Position the illuminator so you can aim it at the place where vehicles pass for recognition - while minimizing the glare into drivers' eyes. In most cases, however, white illuminators are mounted to be aimed at the rear of vehicles. Illuminator aiming is most effective at night. Be sure the opening at the rear of the unit is exposed to the ambient light, so that the photocell can sense the ambient light level (see Figure 6) and Section 8. (In some applications, the photocell may be disabled, so this consideration will not be relevant.) Figure 6. Photocell Exposed to Ambient Light via Rear of Unit Mounting hardware may be included in your package, or packed separately, depending on your site’s requirements. See the Mounting Hardware documentation (see Section 1). Mount illuminators at an appropriate distance away from their associated camera(s), according to the objectives of your project. Contact Inex for guidance/training about this subject. See your camera’s User Guide for details on how to adjust the position of the camera to optimize license plate recognition. As part of this process, you may need to adjust the tilt and/or pan of the illuminator. For instructions on how to adjust the pan and tilt, see the Mounting Hardware documentation (see Section 1). Turn off/disconnect the external (AC) power supply before connecting cables. If you are using an Inex power supply, see its User Guide for important information. All cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded. If you need to add length to the power/signals cable, be sure that: The desired voltage reaches the illuminator If used - the alarm signal levels you need can be sensed from the illuminator by your equipment Table 5. Power/Signals Pinout Pin Power/Signal Wire Color A 12-24 VDC (+) input Red B 12-24 VDC (-) input Black 2 Alarm Output (+) Yellow 3 Alarm Output (-) Green 6 RS485 (A) Blue 7 RS485 (B) White 1,4,5,8 Unused N/A Depending on your project’s requirements, the photocell may have been disabled. The illuminator’s photocell (see Figure 6) samples the ambient light 10 times per second: If all 10 readings are above or below the photocell’s ambient light threshold (300 LUX), then the light turns ON or OFF accordingly. If all readings are not above/below the threshold, then the sampling is performed again. The levels for the alarm output are High (12 VDC) and Low (0 VDC). When the illuminator turns ON, the alarm output will go High (12 VDC) after approximately 200-300 ms. When the illuminator turns OFF, the alarm output will go Low (0 VDC) after approximately 200-300 ms. Use the Inex Camera System’s management software to configure illuminator-related parameters, such as when the illuminator will operate (only at night or all the time). See the management software’s User Guide for further details. You can see active infrared-type LEDs with certain model smartphone cameras to see if the LEDs are working. It is recommended to check all mounting screws for proper tightness once every two years. Always wipe the window gently. Do not use solvents or strong abrasive detergent when cleaning the illuminator. Use a soft dry cloth to clean the front glass when it is dirty. If the dirt has hardened, remove it using mild soap and water, and then wipe the front window gently. Inex Technologies reserves the right to improve and enhance its product offerings.

See the Mounting Hardware documentation for a list of required tools (see Section 1). The following accessories can be supplied by INEX/TECH: Table 3. Required Accessories Inex Can Supply Item Notes 24 VDC power supply (voltage-adjustable) INEX/TECH IZPWR 24 VDC power supply models. It is recommended to use an illuminator power supply separate from the Camera System’s supply. The wavelength of an external illuminator must be compatible with the wavelength of the internal illuminators of the Inex Camera System. The number of illuminator LEDs and beam angle must match the distance rating of the camera being used, as follows: Fewer LEDs and wider beam angles are used for short distances More LEDs and narrower beam angles are used for longer distances See your Camera System’s Installation Guide for a table of Camera-to-Illuminator Recommended Setups. Table 4. Additional Installation Considerations Item Considerations Surge Protection On power, network and data cables Cable Extensions IMPORTANT All network cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded. Power - Use a cable gauge sufficient to deliver 24 VDC at the illuminator, depending on the power supply used Signals - Use a cable gauge sufficient to deliver the required strobe and RS485 signals at the illuminator. Mounting Typically on gantry Additional construction may be needed Position the illuminator so you can aim it at the place where vehicles pass for recognition - while minimizing the glare into drivers' eyes. In most cases, however, white illuminators are mounted to be aimed at the rear of vehicles. Illuminator aiming is most effective at night. Be sure the opening at the rear of the unit is exposed to the ambient light, so that the photocell can sense the ambient light level (see Figure 9). (In some applications, the photocell may be disabled, so this consideration will not be relevant.) Figure 9. Photocell Exposed to Ambient Light via Rear of Unit Mounting hardware may be included in your package, or packed separately, depending on your site’s requirements. See the Mounting Hardware documentation (see Section 1). Mount illuminators at an appropriate distance away from their associated camera(s), according to the objectives of your project. Contact Inex for guidance/training about this subject. See your camera’s User Guide for details on how to adjust the position of the camera to optimize license plate recognition. As part of this process, you may need to adjust the tilt and/or pan of the illuminator. For instructions on how to adjust the pan and tilt, see the Mounting Hardware documentation (see Section 1). Turn off/disconnect the external (AC) power supply before connecting cables. If you are using an Inex power supply, see its User Guide for important information. Different Camera Systems require different wiring for illuminators - see your Camera System’s documentation If you need to add length to the power or signals cables (see Section 5.2), be sure that: the supplied voltage (24 VDC) reaches the illuminator, the strobe signal levels you need reach the illuminator, and the RS485 signal levels reach the illuminator. All cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded. Figure 10. Power and Signals Cables: Wire Colors and Pinouts The pulse width and other parameters that affect illuminator operation are pre-configured according to your project’s requirements. Use the Inex Camera System’s management software to configure illuminator-related parameters, such as when the illuminator will operate (only at night or all the time). See the management software’s User Guide for further details. You can see active infrared-type LEDs with certain model smartphone cameras to see if the LEDs are working. It is recommended to check all mounting screws for proper tightness once every two years. Always wipe the window gently. Do not use solvents or strong abrasive detergent when cleaning the illuminator. Use a soft dry cloth to clean the front glass when it is dirty. If the dirt has hardened, remove it using mild soap and water, and then wipe the front window gently. Inex Technologies reserves the right to improve and enhance its product offerings.

The wavelength of an external illuminator must be compatible with the wavelength of the internal illuminators of the Inex Camera System. The number of illuminator LEDs and beam angle must match the distance rating of the camera being used, as follows: Fewer LEDs and wider beam angles are used for short distances More LEDs and narrower beam angles are used for longer distances See your Camera System’s Installation Guide for a table of Camera-to-Illuminator Recommended Setups. Table 3. Additional Installation Considerations Item Considerations Surge Protection On power, network and data cables Cable Lengths IMPORTANT All network cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded. Illuminator Cable: Use a cable length long enough to: Reach the illuminator from the Camera System Deliver 24 VDC at the illuminator Deliver the required strobe and RS485 signals at the illuminator Mounting Typically on gantry Additional construction may be needed Position the illuminator so you can aim it at the place where vehicles pass for recognition - while minimizing the glare into drivers' eyes. In most cases, however, white illuminators are mounted to be aimed at the rear of vehicles. Illuminator aiming is most effective at night. Mounting hardware may be included in your package, or packed separately, depending on your site’s requirements. See the Mounting Hardware documentation (see Section 1). Mount illuminators at an appropriate distance away from their associated camera(s), according to the objectives of your project. Contact Inex for guidance/training about this subject. See your Camera System’s User Guide for details on how to adjust the position of the camera to optimize license plate recognition. As part of this process, you may need to adjust the tilt and/or pan of the illuminator. For instructions on how to adjust the pan and tilt, see the Mounting Hardware documentation (see Section 1). Turn off/disconnect the external (AC) power supply before connecting cables. If you need to use a longer illuminator cable (see Section 5.2), be sure that: the supplied voltage (24 VDC) reaches the illuminator, the strobe signal levels you need reach the illuminator, and the RS485 signal levels reach the illuminator. All cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded. Figure 6. Illuminator-to-Camera Cable Connections Table 4.

Use the Inex Camera System’s management software to configure illuminator-related parameters, such as when the illuminator will operate (only at night or all the time). See the management software’s User Guide for further details. You can see active infrared-type LEDs with certain model smartphone cameras to see if the LEDs are working. It is recommended to check all mounting screws for proper tightness once every two years. Always wipe the window gently. Do not use solvents or strong abrasive detergent when cleaning the illuminator. Use a soft dry cloth to clean the front glass when it is dirty. If the dirt has hardened, remove it using mild soap and water, and then wipe the front window gently. Inex Technologies reserves the right to improve and enhance its product offerings.

If you have any questions, please contact our support team via our Inex Technologies Website. Click to show the Glossary Table 2. Glossary Term Explanation ALPR Automatic License Plate Recognition DHCP Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. A DHCP server assigns a unique Internet Protocol (IP) address to each device connected to a network. DPU DPU is a generic term for INEX/TECH Data Processing Units. RoadView software can run on INEX/TECH DPUs with graphic processors, or on ALPR All-in-one Camera Systems with built-in processors. IZ Inex/ZAMIR (former company name; now called Inex Technologies, also called INEX/TECH) IZ ALPR system An Automatic License Plate Recognition system utilizing cameras and RoadView software. The IZ ALPR system can capture LPR Events, and transmit them to other systems such as IZCentral. IZCentral Server software that communicates with one or more IZ ALPR systems. IZCentral provides a central repository for all LPR Events generated by the RoadView(s). IZCentral can also interface with many 3rd party systems via their proprietary protocols. LPR Event The identified occurrence of a passing vehicle by the IZ ALPR System. An LPR Event includes metadata (location, lane identifiers, timestamp, the identified license plate number, recognition confidence, and more), plus a set of related images; typically, an Overview image, an LPR camera image and an image of the license plate. Also called a Vehicle Event or Event. An Event may include images from more than one camera in the same Lane. .NET Software framework that runs primarily on Microsoft Windows. See also WCF. NIC Network Interface Card RTSP Real Time Streaming Protocol. A network protocol designed to control streaming media servers. Trigger A command sent to an IZ ALPR system to create an LPR Event. Trigger sources can be from hardware signals, generated by software, or sent by a 3rd party system via various protocols. WCF Windows Communication Foundation. A Microsoft class library that is included with the .NET Framework. See also .NET. ZAP Zamir Application Protocol - Proprietary Inex Technologies protocol for interfacing with an IZ ALPR system and IZCentral. RoadView is advanced ALPR software that reads license plates using sophisticated image recognition algorithms, and creates LPR Events. RoadView sends LPR Event data via HTTP, the proprietary Inex ZAP protocol or other protocols to other systems, typically IZCentral (see the IZCentral User Guide - see Section 1). RoadView can be configured and monitored using a web-based GUI. RoadView can send Events to IZCentral or 3rd party systems using different protocols. See Section 10. You will need to provide a laptop computer to use for configuration. If you will be using the laptop outdoors, the screen must be able to be seen in strong sunlight. Required software: Windows 10 or above - with .NET 4.5 enabled in \"Windows Features\" Chrome or Edge browser Reserve IP addresses for the components in your ALPR system - RoadView computer(s) and camera(s) - see Section 8.2. Use IZ Discovery to find the initial IP Addresses of the cameras connected to your network - see Section 8.3. Log into each camera, and change its IP address according to the requirements of your network. Use fixed addresses. Record these new addresses for use in RoadView configuration. See Section 8.4. Use IZ Discovery to find the IP address of the RoadView computer. Change the computer’s IP address according to the requirements of your network. See Section 8.5 and Section 8.6. Review the different trigger sources and sequences, and triggering operational modes (see Section 10) Log in to RoadView, and configure RoadView using the Settings tab, including adding the connected Lanes and cameras - see Section 11 On the Calibration tab, adjust the zoom and focus to get a clear, sharp picture. Set the expected plate minimum and maximum width, capture zone and other parameters. See Section 15. On the Live tab, verify that Events are being generated for each vehicle passing each camera, and that the recognition has sufficient accuracy and confidence. See Section 12. Use the Search tab to find records stored in the RoadView database. See Section 13. Figure 1. Connecting a Laptop Connect your laptop to the same network switch the computer running RoadView is connected to. The Inex cameras have been pre-configured with default IP addresses. You will probably need to change these addresses to conform to the requirements of your network. Be sure that you have IP addresses reserved for all components of your ALPR system (RoadView computer and cameras). See your camera’s Installation Guide for an explanation of how to determine the initial IP addresses of cameras on your network (using IZ Discovery). You will need this information to log into the cameras, and to change the cameras' IP addresses. See your camera’s Installation Guide for an explanation of how to log in to a camera, and how to edit its IP address (fixed addresses are highly recommended). Record the new addresses; you will need them to configure the RoadView software. See the IZ Discovery User Guide (see Section 1). See the IZ Discovery User Guide (see Section 1). Open a browser (latest version of Chrome or IE 11 or higher). Type in the IP address of the RoadView computer. For example: 192.168.5.110 The RoadView GUI can now be accessed using https at the start of the URL. This enables secure communications with the RoadView GUI. However, due to the type of certification being used, you will see a security error message. Use the options on this warning screen to manually proceed to the RoadView GUI. In the login screen, enter the default username and password: (root, root): Figure 2. Logging In to RoadView You should see the RoadView Live (Journal) tab (see Section 12). To configure RoadView, switch to the Settings tab (see Section 10). Click on the multi-line menu icon at the upper right of the RoadView screen Select \"Change Password\" Figure 3. Change Password (Multi-line Menu) Enter the new password and re-type it Figure 4. Change Password Dialog If you forgot your password, you can reset it as follows: Open a browser (latest version of Chrome or IE 11 or higher). Type in the IP address of the RoadView computer. For example: 192.168.5.110 In the login screen, click on the Reset Password link (see Figure 2). Using the dialog that appears, prepare an email with the Request code, and click Cancel. Figure 5. Request Password Reset Dialog When you get a Reset code back from Inex, repeat the previous steps to open the dialog again, enter the Reset Code in the text box, and click Next. You will see the dialog used for changing a password (see Figure 4) Enter the new password and re-type it Use the new password to log in to RoadView again Click on the multi-line menu icon at the upper right of the RoadView screen Select \"Logout\" Figure 6. Logout (Multi-line Menu) A trigger is a command sent to an IZ ALPR system to create an Event. Triggers can originate from hardware signals, from video analytics or from software/3rd party system protocols. Figure 7. Trigger Sources and Sequence The system constantly captures video frames and stores them in a buffer. However, the Triggering Mode determines if all, or only some of, these frames will be used for license plate recognition and Event building. Other parameters affect how many frames before (pre) and after (post) the trigger will be used: Protocol sections on the Settings tab (see Section 11) Direct Trigger (see Section 11.17) Inex I/O Controller (see Section 11.18) Trigger Offset (see Section 11.21) The number of Trigger Pre and Trigger Post frames (defined when a camera is configured - see Section 11.24) DOT cameras take images of USDOT numbers, but do not perform LPR recognition. However, RoadView will generate Events even without LPR recognition. The Trigger Operational Modes (set in the Detector Configuration section of the Settings tab - see Section 11.22) affect how Events are created (see Figure 8): Figure 8. Trigger Operational Modes NonTriggered - Events are created and reported using LPR video analytics Triggered - Events are created and reported when a trigger is received Triggered mode must be used for DOT (USDOT number image capture) cameras. Hybrid - Events are continually created internally by LPR video analytics, but are only reported when a trigger is received. The Event closest in time to the trigger will be reported (sent to storage). See Section 11.22 where the Hybrid Pre/Post Time parameters are described. In Hybrid mode, if no recognition was possible (no vehicle, no plate, unrecognizable plate, etc.), an Event will be created as it would be in Triggered mode. The Event will be created using frames captured at the time the Trigger was received, along with the Trigger Pre and Post frames, instead of using the frames from the NonTriggered video analytics. See Section 10 and Section 11.24. NonTriggered With Trigger - NonTriggered Events are continually created and reported by LPR video analytics. In addition, Triggered Events are created and reported when a trigger is received. Each type of Trigger Operational Mode has its own advantages: Triggered types require external triggering hardware or software, and are more accurate. All vehicle images are recorded, even if the plate was not recognized. In addition, LPR Events can be generated on demand by third-party systems. NonTriggered types do not require any external triggering hardware (such as inductive loops). However, they are less accurate. Use the Settings tab after the first installation or reinstallation of the IZ ALPR system, or when some fundamental parameters need updating. For example, if the Camera System or DPU was moved to a different location (time zone). Figure 9. Settings Tab After clicking the Save button at the end of the Detector Configuration section, it will take several seconds before the Live tab can start displaying Events. Also, some defaults and/or available parameters may change, depending on the Detector Configuration \"Mode\" selected. The box at the upper right of the Settings screen shows: The RoadView software version The model, part number and serial number of the camera(s) RoadView is communicating with: Figure 10. Software Version and Camera Information Section Figure 11. Network Settings Section If needed, set the RoadView computer’s IP address parameters. The IP Address and Default Gateway must be on the same network. Remember to click the Save button in this section; the change will be applied immediately. The Network Settings refer to the RoadView computer (Camera System or DPU) - NOT the computer on which the browser displaying the GUI is running. It is highly recommended to use a fixed IP address (not DHCP). A fixed IP address enables you to access the computer using the same URL every time, even after unexpected power outages. Figure 12. FTP/SFTP Section Select the desired communication protocol - FTP, SFTP, or both Be sure to click the Save button at the end of this section if you change these protocol selections, or if you enable or disable FTP or SFTP (check boxes). Separate sections will appear for FTP and SFTP, enabling you to click a button to add user(s) who can connect to a RoadView computer via FTP/SFTP FTP users are automatically added as SFTP users Deleting an SFTP user will automatically delete the user from FTP The Port is fixed; this is the port that the users' system will use to communicate with the RoadView computer Figure 13. Adding an SFTP User Each user that appears in the table can be edited or deleted; however, only the password can be edited. In order to rename a user, you will need to delete the existing user and re-enter it. Remember to click Save after changing the password. If a user is added, deleted or changed (except for a password change), the changes are saved automatically The Date and Time Settings refer to the location of the RoadView computer (Camera System or DPU) - NOT the computer on which the browser displaying the GUI is running. The Time Zone selections are organized by continent. For example, the \"America/\" prefix covers various cities and countries in North America (U.S. and Canada) and South America. Figure 14. Date and Time Settings Section Set Time (Automatically/Manually) If Automatic, the date and time will be updated from a central Network Time server. Select the appropriate server, and the interval at which you want RoadView to poll for the date and time (selected from the Polling Interval dropdown). Click the \"Update Now\" button to update the date and time immediately. The icon (green check mark or red \"x\") indicates if the URL of the NTP server is correct, and the connection to it was successful. If Manual, click in the Date and Time box to display a calendar/time popup. You should also select a Time Zone; set it to the local time at the location in which the Camera System/DPU is installed (not the UTC default). Remember to click the Save button at the end of this section after making changes. Figure 15. HTTP Integration Section RoadView can send Events to IZCentral or 3rd party systems using the Inex HTTP Protocol, Inex ZAP Protocol or other protocols. For details about the Inex HTTP protocol, see the appropriate Inex HTTP API Protocol document - see Section 1. RoadView can send Events via HTTP, and act as both a ZAP Server and ZAP Client - all simultaneously. If you are using an IZMobileLPI system, contact Inex for details on how to set the HTTP URL parameter. Click Add HTTP Integration. Note that this feature enables you to use multiple HTTP channels (see Figure 16). Figure 16. Adding an HTTP Integration HTTP URL - URL for an external system to listen on, in order to receive Events from RoadView via the Inex HTTP protocol (see the appropriate Inex HTTP API Protocol document - see Section 1). For an external system, \"api\" at the end of the URL is optional. For IZCentral, \"api\" is mandatory; also, IZCentral currently only works with HTTP API 1.3 (chosen from the Protocol Version dropdown). Be sure to use the correct format: http://:/api For example (port is typically 5801): http://195.163.2.73:5801/api For secure communication, https can be used in the URL. In such a case, use the port registered for secure communication in IZCentral (for example, 11443). However, IZCentral must be configured to accept an encrypted connection (see the IZCentral User Guide for details - see Section 1). Protocol Version - The appropriate HTTP API version to use for your application. Separated Images - If checked, then images are sent in separate messages after the Event message; if unchecked, images and the Event are sent together in the Event message. Send Images Data (automatically checked for HTTP API 2.3 and above, as chosen from the Protocol Version dropdown) - If checked, then image data is sent as \"data base64 encoded\" inside the message; if unchecked, this field is not included in the message. Offline Enabled - Used if you want to enable offline saving of Events and images via HTTP. If you try to send an Event, but do not have a connection to the server, then this event will be put in an offline queue, and sent again when connection with the server is restored. Note that if you enable offline capabilities, you must configure the offline queue parameters (see Section 11.13). Send Triggers (only enabled for HTTP API versions 1.3 to 1.6, as chosen from the Protocol Version dropdown) - If checked, then RoadView will send Trigger Received messages to the server. The meaning of this command is: The camera has received a trigger to create an Event. The Event is being processed, and will be available soon. Send NT Triggers (for protocols 1.x only) - If enabled, if RoadView receives a Non-triggered Event, then RoadView will send a \"Trigger Received\" HTTP API message to the client. Keep Alive Interval (ms) - How often a status message is sent from RoadView to the server Event/Images Timeout (ms) - If an Event or image message cannot be sent for this timeout period, then the event/image is put in the offline queue Trigger Enabled - When an Event is received, send a trigger with recognition data to another RoadView; the second RoadView will create a new Event with the received recognition data. Trigger Lane ID - The Lane ID to which triggers will be sent when the Trigger Enabled parameter is enabled. Status Enabled - When checked, RoadView will send HTTP API status messages to the client. Status Timeout (ms) - If an HTTP API status message cannot be sent to the server for this amount of time, RoadView stops sending the message, and sends it again at the next Keep Alive Interval. Lane ID - The Lane from which Events and statuses will be sent (\"All\" or a specific Lane) After clicking the Save button, adding/editing an integration can take several seconds Each integration (channel) that appears in the table can be edited or deleted If you delete an entry, you will be asked to verify the deletion. This feature is typically used when entry and exit cameras have a direct integration with a 3rd party system. This feature can only be enabled on the exit camera (see Figure 32 in Section 11.23). The LPR entry read is sent to a server connected via our standard HTTP API (usually a 3rd party server). Upon exit, the LPR exit read is compared with all reads stored in the server that have not yet exited. If the match is close enough, then the camera reports the LPR entry read via HTTP API to the 3rd party’s integration system. This enables the 3rd party system to create more accurate entry/exit transactions. Remember to click the Save button at the end of the Detector Configuration section after making changes. Not used; do not enable See the IZCloud document (see Section 1). Figure 17. Raytec LED Illuminators If Raytec LED Illuminators are enabled, their statuses will appear on the System Status tab (see Section 14). URL - Illuminator’s URL Username, Password - Illuminator’s username and password; see the manufacturer’s documentation or ask your system administrator for these credentials. Level - The percentage of LED power to be used; acceptable range is 20-100 Delay On/Off (ms) - The amount of time for RoadView to wait after receiving a signal from an Inex I/O Controller (IZIO) before turning the illuminator ON or OFF (see Section 11.18). Controller signal output can be configured to turn the illuminator ON or OFF, according to the signal received from the controller; see the Signal parameter in this section. IP - IP address of the controller Input - The number of the controller output that RoadView is polling. Signal - The output signal level of the controller defined to turn the illuminator ON. Disabled - RoadView does not use the signal to affect the illuminator High - A high output turns the illuminator ON Low - A low output turns the illuminator ON Click the Add button to add the illuminator to the list Click the Delete button to remove the illuminator from the list Remember to click the Save button at the end of the Detector Configuration section after making changes. See the AMANO document (see Section 1). See the TIBA document (see Section 1). See separate document. Figure 18. Offline Queue Section These parameters are currently used to configure offline Event storage for HTTP Integration (see Section 11.5) Send Offline Events Every - not currently used Expiration Enabled - Enables the following parameters: Offline Events Expire After - If an Event was added to the offline queue because there was no connection with client, and the connection with the client was not restored within this time, the Event will be removed from the offline queue. Send Offline Events After - not currently used Figure 19. Monitoring Section When Monitoring Integration (IZMonitoring Server Integration) is enabled, the following parameters appear: URL - URL of the IZMonitoring Server Keep Alive Timeout (seconds) - How often RoadView sends Keep Alive messages. If the Server does not receive another Keep Alive message before this time expires, the overall status (severity) of the product (camera) will be set to \"Offline\" automatically by the Server. Status Timeout (seconds) - How often RoadView sends a full status message to the Server. Disk Critical Threshold - When the percentage of used space on the disk (where the RoadView storage is located) is above this number, then a critical disk status is sent to the Server. Remember to click the Save button at the end of the Detector Configuration section after making changes. Figure 20. ZAP Integration Section RoadView can send Events to IZCentral or 3rd party systems using the Inex HTTP Protocol (see Section 11.5) and/or the Inex ZAP Protocol. RoadView can send Events via HTTP, and act as both a ZAP Server and ZAP Client - all simultaneously. Remember to click the Save button under the Detection Configuration section after changing these parameters. ZAP Server - Check the box to have RoadView act as a ZAP Server, to which ZAP Clients can connect (see the ZAP Protocol document for details): Ports - Each Lane configured in RoadView will automatically have its own row in the table. Port - Each Lane should have a different port number. This field is automatically populated when a new Lane is added (see Section 11.23), but can be edited. These are the TCP ports that RoadView is listening on for connection from a 3rd party application. Report As - How a ZAP disconnection is reported (via the ZAP protocol) in the ZAP status message (Information, Warning or Critical) Enable Auto Self-Triggering - (Requires Offline to be Enabled in the ZAP section) If enabled, RoadView will switch to Non-triggered mode if a GetStatus message not received from the ZAP client or server. This enables some record/images of the Event to be saved even though triggers can’t be sent. After RoadView re-connects to ZAP, RoadView attempts to send all Events that were created offline back to ZAP. Auto Self-Triggering Timeout - How long (in ms) to wait (after the GetStatus message was not received from the ZAP client or server before switching to Self-Triggering mode ZAP Version - ZAP communication protocol version. It is recommended to use the latest version. The connected clients must use the same version. Confidence Filter - The confidence level below which Events are not sent Keep Time (seconds) - How long a Capture message is to be left in memory before it will be deleted (if a Keep message is not received) Send One LP - If LPR results are found from multiple images of the same Event, RoadView will only send one of them via the ZAP protocol. Images Selection - see Section 11.16 Offline Enabled - Check this box to enable the ZAP offline queue FTP Enabled (for ZAP Server) - When a client is connected to RoadView via ZAP, images can be sent to the client via FTP if this checkbox is checked. FTP Server - The IP address of the FTP server FTP Port - The port on the FTP server listening for FTP messages FTP Folder - The folder path on the FTP server where the images will be stored FTP User - The username used to access the FTP server FTP Password - The password used to access the FTP server FTP Keep Alive Rate (seconds) - The time (in seconds) between attempts to check that the connection with the FTP server is still alive ZAP Client - Check the box to have RoadView act as a ZAP Client, which will connect to a ZAP Server (see the ZAP Protocol document for details). If you want RoadView to work with IZCentral, RoadView can only be working as a ZAP Client. In this mode, the RoadView ZAP Client port must match the IZCentral ZAP port (see the IZCentral documentation - see Section 1) IP - The IP address of the ZAP Server (to which RoadView acting as a client should connect) Port - The TCP port number of the 3rd party application to which RoadView will connect. ZAP Version - ZAP communication protocol version. It is recommended to use the latest version. The 3rd party application being connected to must use the same version. Confidence Filter - The confidence level below which Events are not sent Keep Time (seconds) - How long a Capture message is to be left in memory before it will be deleted (if a Keep message is not received) Offline Enabled - Check this box to enable the ZAP offline queue FTP Enabled (for ZAP Client) - When RoadView is connected to a ZAP server, images can be sent to the server via FTP if this checkbox is checked. (See the FTP Server items for the definition of the additional FTP parameters.) When an Event is generated in triggered or non-triggered modes, the system sends a set of images for that Event. The system can generate two types of Events: In which a license plate was found (License Plate Found) In which a license plate was not found in the images taken (License Plate Not Found) Each image has the following properties: Image type defined by the sensor - LPR or OV Image post-processing - Full, Cropped (cropped from full image) or ROI (region of interest - only the licesnse plate cutout) ALPR/State confidence level - 0 if there is no license plate found in the image, or N a number from 1-99 Set of coordinates in the full image where a license plate was found - 0 if there is no license plate found, or the x1y1, x2y2 coordinates of the license plate LPR Only - (Case 1) A full LPR image where plate is visible, selected from a range of the highest recognition confidence levels, in which the license plate coordinates are closest to the bottom of the frame. (Case 2) If there is no LPR image with a visible license plate, but there is an OV image with a license plate, send one OV image using the same rules as for the LPR image in case 1 for this mode. 1 LPR and 1 LPR ROI - A full LPR image where plate is visible, selected from a range of the highest recognition confidence levels, in which the license plate coordinates are closest to the bottom of the frame - plus a license plate patch image from an LPR frame with the highest confidence level. If there is no LPR image with a visible license plate, but there is an OV image with a license plate, send a full OV image where the plate is visible, selected from a range of the highest recognition confidence levels, in which the license plate coordinates are closest to the bottom of the frame - plus a license plate patch image from an OV frame with the highest confidence level. OV Only - (Case 1) A full OV image where plate is visible, selected from a range of the highest recognition confidence levels, in which the license plate coordinates are closest to the bottom of the frame. (Case 2) If there is no OV image with a visible license plate, but there is an LPR image with a license plate, send one LPR image using the same rules as for the OV image in case 1 for this mode. 1 OV and 1 OV ROI - A full OV image where plate is visible, selected from a range of the highest recognition confidence levels, in which the license plate coordinates are closest to the bottom of the frame - plus a license plate patch image from an OV frame with the highest confidence level. If there is no OV image with a visible license plate, but there is an LPR image with a license plate, send a full LPR image where the plate is visible, selected from a range of the highest recognition confidence levels, in which the license plate coordinates are closest to the bottom of the frame - plus a license plate patch image from an LPR frame with the highest confidence level. 1 Cropped OV and 1 OV ROI - Same as both cases \"1 OV and 1 OV ROI\", but the overall image will be cropped according to the Crop Width and Crop height parameters which appear. The license plate will appear in the center of the cropped image. If the Crop Height is zero, then the width of cropped image will be fixed, and the height of the cropped image will be the same as the proportion of the Crop Width to the original frame. For example, if the original frame’s size is 1600 x 900 pixels, and the Crop Height is 0 and the Crop Width is 800 (half of the original), then the height of the cropped images will be 450 (half of the original) If the Crop Width is zero, then the height of cropped image will be fixed, and the width of the cropped image will be the same as the proportion of the Crop Height to the original frame. 1 OV, 1 OV ROI, 1 LPR, 1 LPR ROI - Same as case 1 of \"1 OV and 1 OV ROI\", together with case 1 of \"1 LPR and 1 LPR ROI\" If there is no LPR image with a visible license plate, LPR images are not sent. If there is no OV image with a visible license plate, OV images are not sent. All OV, all OV ROI, all LPR, all LPR ROI - Send all LPR and OV images, even if there was no plate recognition - plus all LPR and OV ROIs, if there was plate recognition LPR Only - Send one LPR image with a timestamp closest to the trigger timestamp 1 LPR and 1 LPR ROI - Send one LPR image with a timestamp closest to the trigger timestamp OV Only - Send one OV image with a timestamp closest to the trigger timestamp 1 OV and 1 OV ROI - Send one OV image with a timestamp closest to the trigger timestamp 1 OV, 1 OV ROI, 1 LPR, 1 LPR ROI - Images are not sent All OV, all OV ROI, all LPR, all LPR ROI - Send all LPR and all OV images Figure 21. Direct Trigger Section The Direct Trigger settings are used in these operational modes: Triggered, Hybrid or NonTriggered With Trigger (see Section 10). This parameter is used for Camera System models with external trigger input wires, such as the IZA500G. See your Camera System’s Installation Guide for details. A loop controller can provide trigger information to RoadView. You can connect dry or wet contacts to the Camera System’s trigger inputs. The rise and fall of the voltage levels at these inputs sends a trigger to RoadView (see Section 10). The \"trigger time\" used can be influenced by using the rising edge or falling edge of the pulse at the inputs to the Camera System. The Direct trigger mode options are (see Figure 7): Disabled - Triggers will not be generated OnRise - A trigger is generated when the voltage level sensed on the trigger wires moves from low to high OnFall - A trigger is generated when the voltage level sensed on the trigger wires moves from high to low Remember to click the Save button under the Detection Configuration section after changing these parameters. Figure 22. Inex I/O Controller Section The Inex I/O Controller settings are used in Triggered types of operational modes (for example Triggered, Hybrid or NonTriggered With Trigger). See Section 10. These parameters are used if triggers are sent via the LAN using an Inex IZIO Digital I/O Controller. See the IZIO Installation and User Guide for instructions on how to install and configure the IZIO (especially its IP address). See Section 1. The IZIO provides trigger information to RoadView. You can connect dry or wet contacts to the IZIO inputs. The rise and fall of the voltage levels at these inputs (such as pulses from loop controllers) are represented by a bit stream sent by the IZIO/ADAM to RoadView. A change in state of an IZIO input causes the generation of a trigger (see Section 10). In Server mode, advanced P2P mode support was added (available via the IZIO/ADAM configuration application); this enables the IZIO/ADAM to send state changes to multiple RoadView instances. See the P2P document (see Section 1). Pulling or Server - how the digitized pulses are obtained by RoadView Pulling - RoadView will request state changes from the IZIO, sampled every 20 ms Server - IZIO sends a notification of a state change to RoadView (sampling is not needed) Lane ID - The Lane ID as defined in the lower part of the Settings tab IP Address - IZIO’s IP address (configured via the IZIO configuration software. See the IZIO Guide for details (see Section 1). Input - The input channel on the IZIO to be polled/sampled Trigger mode - The \"trigger time\" used can be influenced by using the rising edge or falling edge of the pulse at the IO input of the IZIO/ADAM. The options are (see Figure 7): Disabled - Triggers will not be generated OnRise - A trigger is generated when the voltage level sensed on the trigger wires moves from low to high OnFall - A trigger is generated when the voltage level sensed on the trigger wires moves from high to low Remember to click the Save button under the Detection Configuration section after changing these parameters. Figure 23. Journal Section The Journal (Local Storage) parameters determine if and how Events are stored on the local RoadView computer disk (the parameters only appear if the disk is in use). The Journal data is stored at: /mnt/data/journal If the local RoadView computer disk is not accessible, then the Journal will be stored at: /home/izuser/jsoft/data/journal Cleanup Interval - Interval in milliseconds at which old Events are deleted in order to be within Max Count on Disk Max Count on Disk - Maximum number of Events that can be stored on the RoadView computer’s disk; this parameter should be left at its default If needed, the Max Count on Disk can currently support up to 100,000 events If there is not enough free disk space to accommodate the Max Count on Disk number of Events, the system will delete old Events and store new Events only. Skip Empty Events - (see Figure 24) When an Event does not include a plate recognition, it is ignored. Figure 24. Events Post-Processing Section - Combine Enabled Combine Enabled - used for combining Events with the same or similar recognition Combine Send Timeout - If another Event is received with the same or similar recognition results within this timeout, the two Events are merged into one Event Combine Lev Distance - The maximum Levenshtein distance between the two plate reads for which the Events will be combined (see Section 11.22 for a more detailed explanation of Levenshtein distance). Align to Height - When the LPR and OV images from the Events are merged, RoadView selects the images in which the plate patch is closest to this percentage of the total height of the LPR/OV image. For example, if the images are 1000 pixels high, and this parameter is set to 75%, then RoadView selects images in which the plate patch is closest (either above or below) a virtual line 750 pixels from the top of the image. Figure 25. Events Post-Processing Section - Skip By Distance Enabled Skip By Distance Enabled - used for skipping Events Hold Timeout - How much time between two Events with similar plate reads for the skip to occur. This timeout is renewed after the skip. Skip Lev Distance - If the Levenshtein difference between similar LPR reads from the same lane is less than or equal to the Skip Lev Distance, then the new Event will be skipped. (See Section 11.22 for a more detailed explanation of Levenshtein distance.) Figure 26. Trigger Offset Section The Trigger Offset affects all triggers (in all modes - see Section 10). When Trigger Offset is enabled, the following parameter(s) appear: Offset (in milliseconds) - See Section 10 The trigger command may arrive at a different time than actual trigger’s (physical) arrival time (see Figure 7). For example, there is often a delay between the time a vehicle passes over an inductive loop, and the time the loop controller generates a pulse. This latency can be compensated for by an \"offset\". Figure 27. Detector Configuration Section Plate recognition is done in 3 stages: The position of the license plate is determined in each incoming frame (from each camera) Characters from each license plate image are read and recognized All of the reads of each plate are grouped to create LPR Events The following parameters are used to configure these processes. Remember to click the Save button at the end of this section after changing these parameters: Mode - see Section 10. Note that parameters may appear or be hidden, depending on the chosen Mode. Region - Region for which characters on the plate will be recognized. Select from the following options: Australia Canada/North America - Same as North America LPR, with a different state recognition model that includes Canadian states. Europe Israel North America - General recognition that includes all U.S.A. states North America (OR) - Same as North America, with the addition of syntax checking (against predefined patterns of characters) for Oregon state State - The State within the selected Region for which characters on the plate will be recognized. You can also select \"ALL\"; this indicates that the recognition engine will use a general model for this Region. Skip stacked characters (only for Regions with stacked character plates) - When enabled, causes stacked characters to be excluded from the plate read. Detector confidence threshold - The minimum Detector confidence that this rectangle is a license plate. If a read is at or above this threshold, the image is sent on for plate reading (plate character) processing. Plate reader confidence threshold - The minimum Plate Reader confidence that the characters read are correct. If a read is at or above this threshold, an Event is created. If more than one camera is capturing images from a lane, the image with the highest confidence among the cameras is used. Plate reader regexp filter - Only license plate reads meeting these regular expression filter criteria will have Events created for them. Typically, the default should be used (.* = allow all reads). Min plate read count - To increase read accuracy, plates are read from more than one video frame. If the same plate read results match on at least this number of frames, then the Event will be created. For slow-moving traffic, this parameter should be increased. For faster traffic, you will only be able to set it to a small number of reads. Wait before event emit, ms - (affects results in NonTriggered or Hybrid modes) The minimum time from the first plate read until the time the Event will be built (emitted) - which can result in a greater number of frames used than the \"Min plate read count\" parameter. You may want to get LPR results with better confidence by increasing this number. RoadView will wait for more correct reads before the Event is built (see Figure 28). As a vehicle approaches a camera, waiting longer will usually (depending on road geometry) result in images of the plate getting larger and easier to read accurately. Note that in hybrid mode, it is recommended to set this parameter greater than 0. Setting this parameter to 0 will result in lower read confidence, since the trigger and the first read will occur close together. Figure 28. Illustration of Wait Before Event Emit LP forget interval, ms - RoadView may not have been able to read a plate over the course of several frames, which appear between two groups of frames with correct reads. If the size of this \"hole\" is large, then the vehicle has probably disappeared but then returned. This value controls whether or not to consider the two sequences of captures to be a single Event, or two separate Events. Figure 29. Illustration of LP Forget Interval Max Levenshtein distance - Different reads of the same plate may not be identical due to shadows, sunlight, blurred images, etc. However, we want to minimize these effects by treating slightly different reads as the same result. We allow a maximum \"distance\" (number of changes required to match two strings) between plate reads in an Event. If the distance is less than or equal to this parameter, then the comparison is considered to be a valid match for the Event. LPR JPEG quality, 0-100 (0=no frame sent) - The quality level used to send and store LPR images after recognition is performed OV JPEG quality, 0-100 (0=no frame sent) - The quality level used to send and store OV images after recognition is performed Plate JPEG quality, 0-100 (0=no frame sent) - The quality level used to send and store plate patch images after recognition is performed Include all images (for \"Triggered\" and \"NonTriggered With Trigger\" modes only) - Enables display in Live tab, and sending of all images (including pre- and post-trigger frames) - not only the \"best\" ones that were used for plate recognition Include all LPR results - include all plate reads in the Event (not just the ones with the best confidence) Image Resize - When enabled, and the Event confidence is equal or higher than the Resize Confidence parameter, then each LPR and OV image is resized according to the Image Width (and the height is resized proportionally). Image Width - The resize width Resize Confidence - The Event confidence threshold for enabling resizing Two Line Plate - When enabled, invokes the capability to recognize two-line plates (in which the license plate number consists of two rows). Threshold - If the ratio of the width of the plate to its height is less than this threshold, then the plate very likely has two lines. The plate read will be the lower number added to the upper number. Padding Width (%) - The percentage of the width of the plate to be removed from each side of the upper and lower images before putting the two numbers together. This eliminates empty space before the composite number is sent for recognition. Padding Height (%) - The percentage of the height of the plate This percentage is measured from the top, to determine where to crop the plate to determine how to extract the upper number’s image This same percentage is measured from the bottom, to determine where to crop the plate to determine how to extract the lower number’s image Vehicle Class Detection - Enables/disables vehicle class detection (car, bus, etc.). This item can be shown on the Live tab using the multi-line menu at the upper right of the screen (see Section 12). State recognition - Enables state recognition (an Overview camera must have been defined and configured) Send default state (only if State recognition is enabled) - If no State was recognized, checking this box enables sending the Default State Value in the HTTP message for the Event as per the following additional parameters that appear: (If unchecked, no State field will be sent in the message.) Default state value - The default value to be sent in the HTTP message for the Event if no State was recognized. State confidence threshold - The minimum confidence percentage for State recognition LPR Stub Enabled - If a plate was detected, but without a plate read, RoadView sends the text defined in the LPR Stub text box, along with the LPR Stub Confidence value: LPR Stub - For example, \"NOREAD\" LPR Stub Confidence - For example, 0 Hybrid Pre Time (for Hybrid mode only) - Time in milliseconds before the trigger to search for the closest Event to the trigger (see Figure 30) Hybrid Post Time (for Hybrid mode only) - Time in milliseconds after the trigger to search for the closest Event to the trigger (see Figure 30) Figure 30. Illustration of Hybrid Pre/Post Time Trigger 1 will be checked against the Hybrid Pre/Post time and use the closest Event - Event 1 or Event 2 (most likely). Note that Trigger 1 is closest to Event 2, even though it is closer to the best LPR frame in Event 1. Trigger 2 will use Event 2. Trigger 3 will wait for a new Event. If a new Event does not arrive within the Hybrid Post Time, a trigger Event will be created, without an LPR read, but with associated images and a timestamp. Figure 31. Lanes Section Actions: Edit - Edit the Lane’s parameters Delete - Delete the Lane (a warning will be displayed) Trigger - Send a software trigger immediately to RoadView (works in all modes except NonTriggered) Each Lane number must be unique in the overall IZ ALPR system. The images from all cameras capturing the same physical lane will be combined into a single Event. Each \"Lane\" is actually a virtual Lane. For example, if you have two Camera Systems capturing the same physical lane, you will need to create two different \"Lanes\", and associate each Camera System’s cameras with a different \"Lane\". Figure 32. Add/Edit Lane Dialog ID (required) - The identification number of the lane to be captured by the cameras. This number will appear associated with Events in the Live tab (see Section 12). Name (required) - The name of the Lane as it will appear in the GUI. This name will also be sent in HTTP and ZAP messages. If you have upgraded from a previous RoadView version in which only Lane IDs were specified, Lane names will be automatically assigned the word \"Lane\" plus the Lane ID. Avg Speed (for DOT cameras only) - The average vehicle speed expected in this Lane Distance (for DOT cameras only) - The distance between the trigger device and the camera Location (for ALPR cameras only) - Select one of the following options: Unknown - The camera’s position relative to vehicles is unknown. Front - The camera in this Lane is capturing images from the front of vehicles Rear - The camera in this Lane is capturing images from the rear of vehicles Passageway (for specific sites) - Select one of the following options (see Section 11.6): Unknown - It is unknown if the camera in this Lane is capturing entering or exiting vehicles Entry - The camera in this Lane is capturing images from vehicles entering Exit - The camera in this Lane is capturing images from vehicles exiting Ignore Opposite Direction - if enabled, then all Events for vehicles moving in the direction opposite to the direction arrow in the Calibration tab will be ignored (see Section 15). Note that you can add a Direction column to the Live and Search tabs using the multi-line menu at the upper right of the screen (see Section 12). Figure 33. Cameras Section If you are using an IZMobileLPI system, contact Inex for details on how to set the camera parameters. Actions: Edit - Edit the camera’s parameters (see Figure 34) Delete - Delete the camera (a warning will be displayed) Camera table headers: Camera ID, Lane ID, Name, URL, Type (as configured when the camera was added) Image - Thumbnail image from a recent camera image If you add a camera, or edit a camera’s parameters and click the Save button in the Camera Add/Edit dialog (even if you did not change the URL), you may see a warning icon in the Image column. The reappearance of the image indicates that the core software has restarted, and Events will resume being captured and displayed in the Live tab. Add Camera (button at end of Cameras section): Figure 34. Add/Edit Camera Dialog Lane ID - The identification number of the lane being captured by the camera(s). Select a Lane number you defined (see Section 11.23). This number will appear associated with Events in the Live tab (see Section 12). The images from all cameras capturing the same physical lane will be combined into a single Event. Using the same Lane ID for different cameras (even the LPR and OV cameras within the same Camera System) will combine the reads into one Event (see Section 11.23). You may even be able to improve read accuracy by changing the zoom to have one camera \"see\" closer than the other one. You could also position cameras to be in different positions (front/rear as in a toll plaza). Camera ID - For internal use; should be unique in the overall IZ ALPR system Name - Camera name for internal use; should be unique in the overall IZ ALPR system URL - RTSP or HTTP URL: RTSP stream URL example: rtsp:///cam0_0 HTTP URL example: http:// Type - Type of camera (LPR, View or DriverFace) The Trigger Pre and Trigger Post parameters cannot both be zero. Trigger Pre (used in Triggered mode types only) - Number of frames to be included in the set of frames used to build an Event - before the trigger occurs (see Figure 7). Trigger Post (used in Triggered mode types only) - Number of frames to be included in the set of frames used to build an Event - after the trigger occurs (see Figure 7) Figure 35. Live (Journal) Tab with Row Selected The Live tab displays Events and other data about each Event. The Events displayed in the Live tab are being simultaneously sent via the protocols you selected in the Settings tab. You should see that Events are being generated for each vehicle passing each camera, with sufficient recognition accuracy and confidence. If not, see Section 17 for troubleshooting tips. If you return to the Live tab from another tab, the large picture returns to the OV (color) camera image. DOT (USDOT number image capture) cameras generate Events, but without LPR reads. Each row includes (additional items can be added from the multi-line menu icon > Configure Journal selection - see Section 12): Transaction (Event) ID. Note that each Event has a unique ID, regardless of which camera it came from. Lane Name - Lane name as configured for the camera(s) viewing this lane in the Settings tab - see Section 11.23 Date and time when the Event was recorded License Plate number (LPR) Recognition confidence, expressed as a percentage To add columns to the Live (and Search) tab displays: Click on the multi-line menu icon at the upper right of the RoadView screen Select \"Configure Journal\" (see Figure 36) Figure 36. Configure Journal (Multi-line Menu) Select the additional columns to display, such as: State (state displayed on plate), State Confidence (confidence that the state has been recognized accurately), Class (vehicle class, such as car or truck), Class Confidence (confidence that the class has been recognized accurately) and Direction (direction vehicle was traveling - forward or backward - according to the direction arrow configured in the Calibration tab - see Section 15). (These additional columns will also appear on the Search tab - see Section 13.) Pause/Run mode: Pause the grid display by clicking on a row, or by using the pause button in the middle of the controls under the large image (). You can also click on the large image to toggle between Pause and Run mode. This is useful if you want to examine a specific Event. You can also use these controls to move through the grid (next/previous Event, or start/end of Events). Start the display running in real-time again using the Run button () or by clicking on the large image. This will refresh the display, and resume displaying Events, starting from the 20 most recent Events. RoadView is continually recording and saving (Journal) Events. The Events are added to the Live display (Running mode operation) until the display is paused. Even when you pause the Live display, RoadView continues to record Events - and can display up to a maximum of 20 recent Events. As you Pause/Run the Live grid, you may see momentary icons ( ) appearing in the middle of the large image pane to indicate the mode. The text below the Pause/Run controls displays a summary of the Event’s information. The thumbnail images below the larger image pane display the overview (first row), LPR (second row) and plate patch (third row) images from each camera. (For triggered modes) Images with a blue border are pre-trigger frames (see Figure 34) (For triggered modes) Images with an orange border are post-trigger frames (see Figure 34) Hover over a thumbnail to display date/time information for each camera or confidence for the plate patch images. Click on a thumbnail to display it in the larger image pane. Zoom in on an area of interest in the large image (requires a mouse with a wheel): Pause the grid Hover (do not click) over the area of interest; the cursor will change to a magnifying glass. Mouse wheel up a little at a time to enlarge the image As the image enlarges, you may need to readjust the cursor position to re-focus on the area of interest To save images, right-click on the large image pane, and save the image Figure 37. Search Tab The Search tab enables you to search for Event records stored in the RoadView database. The same columns that were added to the Live display (using the multi-line menu at the upper right of the screen) will also appear in the Search display (see Section 12). Page controls are located at the upper right of the records grid: Figure 38. Search Tab: Page Controls Filter boxes are located at the top of each column; you can click on the question mark icons to show explanations of what you can enter in each filter box. After applying filters, remember that you will need to use the page controls to see all of the filtered records. For example, if there are 85 results, but you configured the grid to display 20 records per page, you must use the page controls to see the filtered records appearing on each page. Numeric filters (Event ID, Confidences) - Enter a specific number (example '30'), a number and a '>' symbol (example '>30') or a number and a '<' symbol (example '<30') Lane Name - Select All, or a specific lane Time - Click in the filter box to display a date/time selection popup. Uncheck the check box to clear the filter (see Figure 39). Figure 39. Search Tab: Time Filter Selection Popup Use the buttons at the top of the From/To sections to move between months Use the calendar grids to select dates Use the sliders to specify time Click the Now button to select the current time/date Text filters (LPR, State, Class) - Enter characters to find within the strings. For example, KZ will find KZR3791 and JKZ0714. Direction - Select All, Forward, (Unknown) or Backward Figure 40. System Status Tab This tab displays statuses of different RoadView components. In order to see the illuminator status information, you must enable its display on the System Info tab (see Section 16). Figure 41. Calibration Tab When you see a vehicle at a typical capture position on the video, click on the video to pause it. It is recommended to use the view called \"Draw image by maintaining aspect ratio (two-headed arrow)\". You select this view by clicking on the right-most button at the upper left of the screen: Select a camera from the dropdown list (LPR or OV). The Frame Width (horizontal) and Frame Height (vertical) are displayed at the lower left, and are set automatically according to the Camera’s hardware configuration. See your Camera’s Installation and Calibration Guide. The Frame Timestamp at the lower left displays the date and time that the image is being taken/was taken by the camera. Aim the camera using the mounting bracket’s adjustment hardware (see Figure 42). Pan: Adjust the Pan so that the image of the license plate is in the horizontal middle of the Field of View. Tilt: Adjust the Tilt so that the image of every expected plate position (depending on the vehicle type, such as passenger cars, jeeps, trucks, etc.) will be in the middle of the screen (from top to bottom). Roll: Adjust the Roll so the license plate’s image is horizontally straight, parallel to the ground (not tilted to one side). Figure 42. Pan/Tilt/Roll (Angle) Adjustments When the correct position is achieved, make a preliminary tightening of the mounting screws. Define the Region of Interest (ROI) by dragging on the corners (vertices) of the trapezoidal region. For optimum recognition accuracy, the ROI should be large enough to capture the region where plates could be found in images. The following settings for the LPR and OV cameras are saved separately. For example, you may want a Region of Interest that is different for each camera. Define the Plate Width Min: Events will only be created for plate reads whose width is greater than or equal to this parameter. It is recommended to enter 150 in the Plate Width Min text box. This parameter can also be configured by dragging the small circle on the horizontal line on the Calibration tab (expressed in pixels). This parameter can be used to ignore small plate reads. For example, if the image was taken when a vehicle is too far away, the characters are too small to be read - even by a human. Define the Plate Width Max: Events will only be created for plate reads whose width is less than or equal to this parameter. It is recommended to enter approximately 350 in the Plate Width Max text box. This parameter can also be configured by dragging the large circle on the horizontal line on the Calibration tab (expressed in pixels). This parameter can be used to prevent false reads, such as large numbers on trucks. Use the zoom and focus buttons to adjust the view of the video until the width of the plate is 150 pixels, and its plate image is clear and sharp. (The surrounding items, such as the vehicle body, do not need to be as sharp as the plate.) There is a delay between a click of a zoom/focus button and when you see the effect on the screen. Be sure to wait until you see the change on the screen before clicking the button again. Clicking the button multiple times will cause you to \"overshoot\" the desired zoom/focus. As you adjust the zoom and focus, you may need to reposition the camera in order to get the image of the plate back to the desired position. Direction (red arrow on video): Drag the head of the arrow around to point to the angle at which you expect vehicles to be moving. (The vehicle’s direction is also sent to the IZCloud as part of an Event.) You can add a Direction column to the Live and Search tabs using the multi-line menu at the upper right of the screen (see Section 12). You can set the \"Ignore Opposite Direction\" parameter in the Lanes section to ignore all Events for vehicles moving in the direction opposite to the direction arrow (see Section 11.23). When you have finished, click the Save button. Wait several seconds for the display to refresh automatically, which indicates that the RoadView recognition software is running again with the updated parameters. When the correct position is achieved, make a final tightening of the mounting hardware. Repeat these steps for the other camera. Figure 43. System Info Tab Some System Info sections may not appear depending on your version of RoadView This section provides the same information as in the upper right corner of the same Settings tab, namely the model, part number and serial number of the camera(s) RoadView is communicating with. Firmware Version - The firmware version of the IZIC board (proprietary Inex electronics) in the Camera System/DPU New Firmware - Enables you to update new firmware in the IZIC board Choose File - click this button to browse for the firmware file Update Firmware - click this button to update the firmware using the file you chose When enabled, illuminator status items are displayed on the System Status tab (see Section 14), and these status items are sent via ZAP. These parameters affect how RoadView controls an external illuminator: Night Mode Disable - never trigger the illuminator Enable - camera and external illuminator behavior are optimized for night-time recognition. Recommended use is for calibration. OV LED Intensity - Relative intensity of the built-in white LEDs, expressed as a percentage of the maximum possible intensity Illuminator Intensity - (for IZS illuminators, synchronized with the Overview camera) Relative intensity of an external illuminator’s LEDs, expressed as a percentage of the maximum possible intensity Auto - automatically senses day/night, in order to decide whether to trigger an external illuminator, according to the Camera System’s location (as defined by the Latitude and Longitude parameters). For the Auto mode, additional parameters appear: Latitude and Longitude are user-entered coordinates; determine them using Google maps, by clicking on the location where the Camera System will be installed (remember to put in a minus sign as needed) Latitude - latitude coordinate of Camera System’s location Longitude - longitude coordinate of Camera System’s location Post-Sunrise Offset - time after actual sunrise to be considered as the start of the day Pre-Sunset Offset - time before actual sunset to be considered the end of the day Remember to click the Save button at the end of this section after making changes. These parameters enable you to control the camera’s built-in IR LEDs. Mode Off - LEDs off Multi-flash - Each frame is illuminated with a different light intensity Anti-flickering - Reduces the visible flickering of the built-in IR LED illumination by disabling multi-flash mode and adjusting flash frequency Intensity - light intensity in percent, where 0 is no light, and 100 is maximum light For details about items in the following list related to hardware or configuration, see your camera’s Installation and Calibration Guide. Table 3. Troubleshooting Symptom Possible Solution Thumbnails in Settings tab (in the Camera section at the bottom) have been replaced by red exclamation points and/or The Live tab and Search tab are empty (no Events are detected) Verify that each camera’s IP address in the Camera System (or connected to the DPU), and the RoadView computer’s IP address are all on the same subnet. Verify that stable power at the correct level is being supplied to the cameras, even when under a heavy processing load. Verify that the IP address(es) configured in RoadView match the IP addresses that you configured in the camera(s). See Section 11.24. Recognition rates are low On the Calibration tab, increase the size of the Region of Interest (ROI) - it may be too small to capture plates with high confidence On the Calibration tab, try to reduce the Plate Width Min and increase the Plate Width Max Examine the video from the camera on the Calibration tab: If all license plates are not fully visible, re-aim the camera so that the camera’s field of view fully covers the capture zone. For a more precise adjustment, verify that the license plate’s images are as close to the middle of the video display as possible. If the images are spotted, remove dirt and dust from the front window of the camera with a soft cloth and mild soap If the images are not sharp, adjust the zoom and focus of the camera Inex Technologies reserves the right to improve and enhance its product offerings.

It has evolved into a comprehensive ecosystem that incorporates cutting-edge technologies to ensure the safety of all airport users, from passengers to staff. Today’s airports need to be at the forefront of this revolution. Introducing the Inex Solution for Airport Security: Face recognition alerts Vehicle security alerts Unattended baggage alerts Suspicious behavior alerts Terminal population count and crowding alerts Intelligent AI video analytics Virtual patrols Our advanced face recognition algorithms scan and match faces from various locations within the terminal. Identification of suspected individuals on a watchlist can generate real-time alerts, ensuring that potential security threats are identified and addressed early. Inex AI license plate recognition quickly and accurately identifies blacklisted vehicles, ensuring immediate action at roads or checkpoints. This capability provides increased perimeter and parking lot security, prevention of unauthorized vehicles from accessing sensitive areas, and timely responses to potential threats. Unattended baggage is a security threat often overlooked. Cameras identify baggage left unattended for prolonged periods, alerting security teams instantly. The system can associate each piece of baggage with its original owner, reducing false alerts caused by other people in the vicinity of the abandoned bag. People tracking systems can alert security personnel to suspicious behaviors. These include people running, walking in the opposite direction, stopping, or not carrying baggage. Such alerts can provide early warning of potential security threats. Real-time people counting systems can determine the number of individuals in the terminal at any given moment. This enables efficient terminal management, better resource allocation during peak times, and swift emergency evacuation when needed. Areas that often experience crowding can be monitored, such as security checks, check-ins, and baggage claim zones. You can enhance your passenger experience by preventing prolonged waiting times, and ensuring optimal staff allocation during rush hours. Integrated with AI-driven video analytics, our system pairs seamlessly with your existing CCTV infrastructure, and maximizes accuracy while reducing false positives. For example, our ALPR analytics can determine the classification, color and make of a vehicle. Virtual patrol is a concept that includes several of the video-based airport security system features mentioned here. You can use technology to simulate or enhance traditional physical patrolling conducted by security personnel, especially in areas off-limits to normal people traffic. A site can be monitored remotely without the need for on-site guards. Here is a partial list of major Inex projects for airports and security clients.

Legal Disclaimer RoadView is advanced ALPR software that reads license plates using sophisticated image recognition algorithms, and creates LPR Events. RoadView sends LPR Event data via HTTP or other protocols to other systems. The PTL system records Events for vehicles that are in the lane, and compares them with a list of authorized vehicles (White List). This document describes how to configure the Inex Motorola PTL system. RoadView can be configured using both a web-based GUI and an API. Some parameters can only be configured/controlled via the API, others only via the GUI, and some via both (see Table 1). See the API document for further details. Table 1.

If needed, use IZ Discovery to change its IP address to one you have allocated in your network. The IZ Discovery utility discovers all active devices connected to the network, and displays a list of their network parameters. These devices can include cameras and computers. If any device on your network is connected via wireless, IZ Discovery will not recognize the device. In addition, if the computer running IZ Discovery is connected via wireless, you will not see any devices displayed. Download the IZ Discovery software (link) Run IZ Discovery When IZ Discovery first runs, you may see a Windows security warning. If so, click Run. If you see a message related to the Windows firewall, click Allow. IZ Discovery will start and display a list of devices on the network, according to their serial numbers (see Figure 1). Scroll down to find the device you are interested in. You can double-click to view/edit a specific device’s IP address parameters (see Section 4.2). Click Clear List to refresh the discovery process. Figure 1. IZ Discovery Utility If IZ Discovery does not recognize a device: Press the device’s reset button (if available) Reset the device by shutting off power/removing the LAN cable, waiting 5 seconds, and reapplying power Check the LAN cable between your laptop and the network, and the LAN cable between the device and the LAN switch. Replace the cable(s) and run IZ Discovery again. Figure 2. Changing the Device’s Network Settings It is highly recommended to use a fixed IP address (not DHCP). A fixed IP address enables you to access the computer using the same URL every time, even after unexpected power outages. A dynamic IP address may change upon device reboot. Before opening the web interface, you will have to find the current IP address of the device using IZ Discovery. If you want to copy the IP address (for login to the device) you will need to uncheck the DHCP checkbox momentarily to make the address field accessible. For devices using RoadView software, you can change the IP address using the RoadView Settings tab. To change the device’s mode (fixed or dynamic [DHCP]), or IP address: Select the relevant line in the list of devices and double-click on it. The Network Settings window appears To change the mode: Check or uncheck the DHCP box Click Save To change the IP address: Verify that the address is not used by any other device on the network Be sure to uncheck the DHCP box Enter the network address parameters Write down the new IP Address and click Save The change should be reflected in the main dialog. This can take about a minute until the IP is obtained. If you do not see the change after this time, close IZ Discovery, and then reopen it. Verify that the IP address parameters have been changed to the ones you wanted. If not, you will have to log into the device (or RoadView) and change the IP address. Move a vehicle next to, and at the middle of the capture line. (This is the position at which the vehicle detector signals that the vehicle is present.) Ensure that the camera is aimed at the middle of the lane, and is at the required capture distance. Alternatively, in a lab, position a license plate at the expected distance and height. Open a browser. Type in the IP address of the RoadView computer - the IZIDPUGOX. You must put \"https://\" before the IP address. For example: https://192.168.5.110 If you see a browser security warning message: Click Advanced Click the \"Continue\" link You will see the login screen. Enter the default username and password (root, root): Figure 3. Logging In to RoadView You should see the RoadView Live (Journal) tab (see Section 10). Click on the multi-line menu icon at the upper right of the RoadView screen Select \"Change Password\" Figure 4. Change Password (Multi-line Menu) Enter the new password and re-type it Figure 5. Change Password Dialog Click on the multi-line menu icon at the upper right of the RoadView screen Select \"Logout\" Figure 6. Logout (Multi-line Menu) Use the Settings tab after the first installation or re-installation of the PTL system, or when some fundamental parameters need updating. For example, if the IZIDPUGOX was moved to a different location (time zone). Configure the parameters in the order in this section of the document. After clicking the Save button at the end of the Detector Configuration section, it will take several seconds before the Live tab can start displaying Events. Also, some defaults and/or available parameters may change, depending on the Detector Configuration \"Mode\" selected. The box at the upper right of the Settings screen shows: The RoadView software version (verify that the version is correct) The model, part number and serial number of the DPU that RoadView is communicating with: Figure 7. Software Version and DPU Information Section Figure 8. Network Settings Section If needed, set the IZIDPUGOX IP address parameters. Remember to click the Save button in this section; the change will be applied immediately. The Network Settings refer to the IZIDPUGOX computer - NOT the computer on which the browser displaying the GUI is running. It is highly recommended to use a fixed IP address (not DHCP). A fixed IP address enables you to access the DPU using the same URL every time, even after unexpected power outages. The Date and Time Settings refer to the location of the IZIDPUGOX computer - NOT the computer on which the browser displaying the GUI is running. The Time Zone selections are organized by continent. For example, the \"America/\" prefix covers various cities and countries in North America (U.S. and Canada) and South America. Figure 9. Date and Time Settings Section Set Time (Automatically/Manually) - The preferred setting is \"Set Time Automatically\". If Automatic, the date and time will be updated from a central NTP (Network Time) server; the server can be in the cloud or on a local NTP server. (The default is ntp.ubuntu.com.) Enter the NTP server URL Select the interval at which you want RoadView to poll for the date and time (selected from the Polling Interval dropdown). Click the \"Update Now\" button to update the date and time immediately. The icon (green check mark or red \"x\") indicates if the URL of the NTP server is correct, and if the connection to it was successful. If an NTP server is not available, select Manual. Click in the Date and Time box to display a calendar/time popup. Select a Time Zone; set it to the local time at the location in which the DPU is installed (not the UTC default). Remember to click the Save button at the end of this section after making changes. Figure 10. Web Protocols Section The parameters should already have been set for you; verify the settings look as they appear here. If you need to change the settings, remember to click the Save button at the end of this section. Figure 11. HTTP Integrations Security Section The parameters should already have been set for you; verify the settings look as they appear here. If you need to change the settings, remember to click the Save button at the end of the Detector Configuration section. Use this section to add and configure Lanes. Figure 12. Lanes Section Edit - edit the Lane’s parameters Delete - delete the Lane (a warning will be displayed) Trigger - send a software trigger immediately to RoadView Each Lane number must be unique in the overall ALPR system. The images from all cameras capturing the same physical lane will be combined into a single Event. Each \"Lane\" is actually a virtual Lane. For example, if you have two cameras capturing the same physical lane, you will need to create two different \"Lanes\", and associate each camera with a different \"Lane\". Figure 13. Add/Edit Lane Dialog ID (required) - The identification number of the lane to be captured by the cameras. This number will appear associated with Events in the Live tab. Name (required) - The name of the Lane as it will appear throughout the user interface (GUI). Location - Select one of the following options: Unknown - the camera’s position relative to vehicles is unknown. Front - the camera in this Lane is capturing images from the front of vehicles Rear - the camera in this Lane is capturing images from the rear of vehicles Passageway - Unused Ignore Opposite Direction - Unused Figure 14. Cameras Section Edit - edit the camera’s parameters (see Figure 15) Delete - delete the camera (a warning will be displayed) Camera table headers: Camera ID, Lane ID, Name, URL, Type (as configured when the camera was added) Image - Thumbnail image from a recent camera image If you add a camera, or edit a camera’s parameters and click the Save button in this dialog (even if you did not change the URL), you may see a warning icon in the Image column. The reappearance of the image indicates that the core software has restarted, and Events will resume being captured and displayed in the Live tab, with the following changes: - The Event ID will continue to increase from the last Event ID. - The history of previous Events for that camera will be cleared Add Camera (button at end of Cameras section): Figure 15. Add/Edit Camera Dialog Lane ID - The identification number of the lane being captured by the camera(s). Select a Lane number you defined (see Section 7.6). This number will appear associated with Events in the Live tab. The images from all cameras capturing the same physical lane will be combined into a single Event. Using the same Lane ID for different cameras will combine the reads into one Event (see Section 7.6). You can position multiple cameras to be in different positions for the same lane (front/rear). Camera ID - For internal use; should be unique in the overall ALPR system Name - Camera name for internal use; should be unique in the overall ALPR system URL - RTSP URL Type - Type of camera (View) Video Recording Enabled - Check the box to enable video recording Video Pre Time - How much time before the Event to record video; set as shown Video Post Time - How much time after the Event to record video; set as shown Enable Motorola Integration and set the parameters as follows. Remember to click the Save button at the end of the Detector Configuration section after making changes. Figure 16. Motorola Integration Section Motorola URL - URL of the Motorola server Motorola User Name - domain and username (in the form domain/username) to access the Motorola server Motorola Password - password to access the Motorola server Camera Port - the HTTPS port on which RoadView listens for commands from the Motorola server Log Store Days - how long Motorola logs are stored in the RoadView database; also defines how long Events are stored in the offline queue Keep Alive Interval - how often RoadView sends a Keep Alive message to the Motorola server Offline Enabled - enables the Offline Queue for Events sent to the Motorola server; should always be enabled Figure 17. Journal Settings Section Check the Enabled checkbox - should always be enabled Remember to click the Save button at the end of the Detector Configuration section after making changes. Set the parameters as shown here Remember to click the Save button at the end of this section after changing these parameters. Figure 18. Detector Configuration Section Explanations of frequently used parameters: Mode - Note that parameters may appear or be hidden, depending on the chosen Mode. NonTriggered - Events are created and reported by LPR video analytics Region - Region for which characters on the plate will be recognized. Select from the following options: Israel The software version and DPU information appear as shown here Figure 19. Calibration Tab When you see a vehicle at a typical capture position on the video, click on the video to pause it. It is recommended to use the view called \"Draw image by maintaining aspect ratio (two-headed arrow)\". You select this view by clicking on the right-most button at the upper left of the screen: Select a camera from the dropdown list The Frame Width (horizontal) and Frame Height (vertical) are displayed at the lower left, and are set automatically. The Frame Timestamp at the lower left displays the date and time that the image is being taken/was taken by the camera. Aim the camera using the mounting bracket’s adjustment hardware (see Figure 20). Pan: Adjust the Pan so that the image of the license plate is in the horizontal middle of the Field of View. Tilt: Adjust the Tilt so that the image of every expected plate position (depending on the vehicle type, such as passenger cars, jeeps, trucks, etc.) will be in the middle of the screen (from top to bottom). Roll: Adjust the Roll so the license plate’s image is horizontally straight, parallel to the ground (not tilted to one side). Figure 20. Pan/Tilt/Roll (Angle) Adjustments When the correct position is achieved, make a preliminary tightening of the mounting screws. Define the Region of Interest (ROI) by dragging on the corners (vertices) of the trapezoidal region. For optimum recognition accuracy, the ROI should be large enough to capture the region where plates could be found in images. The following settings for the cameras are saved separately. For example, you may want a Region of Interest that is different for each camera. Define the Plate Width Min: Events will only be created for plate reads whose width is greater than or equal to this parameter. Enter the desired value in the Plate Width Min text box. This parameter can also be configured by dragging the small circle on the horizontal line on the Calibration tab (expressed in pixels). This parameter can be used to ignore small plate reads. For example, if the image was taken when a vehicle is too far away, the characters are too small to be read - even by a human. Define the Plate Width Max: Events will only be created for plate reads whose width is less than or equal to this parameter. Enter the desired value in the Plate Width Max text box. This parameter can also be configured by dragging the large circle on the horizontal line on the Calibration tab (expressed in pixels). This parameter can be used to prevent false reads, such as large numbers on trucks. Direction (red arrow on video): Not used When you have finished, click the Save button. Wait several seconds for the display to refresh automatically, which indicates that the RoadView recognition software is running again with the updated parameters. When the correct position is achieved, make a final tightening of the mounting hardware. Repeat these steps for other cameras. Using a license plate mounted in a lab, or by driving a vehicle through the lane, verify that an Event is generated with the correct plate read, as recorded in the RoadView Live (Journal) tab. Figure 21. Live (Journal) Tab Once the lane is active, verify that Events are being generated for each vehicle passing each camera, and that the recognition has sufficient accuracy and confidence. You can use the Search tab to find Event records stored in the RoadView database. Note that you can add/remove different columns on the Live and Search tabs by selecting \"Configure Journal\" from the multi-line menu at the upper right of the screen (see Section 6.2). Figure 22. Search Tab Click on each thumbnail under the large Event image pane to see overview and plate images To see the video clip used to create the Event, click on the Video link under the thumbnails You can use the System Status tab to check the statuses of different system components Figure 23. System Status Tab Table 2. RoadView Troubleshooting Symptom Possible Solution Thumbnails in Settings tab, in the Camera section at bottom have been replaced by red exclamation points and/or The Live tab and Search tab are empty (no Events are detected) Verify that each camera’s IP address, and the RoadView computer’s IP address are all on the same subnet. Verify that stable power at the correct level is being supplied to the cameras, even when under a heavy processing load. Verify that the IP address(es) configured in RoadView match the IP addresses that you configured in the camera(s). See Section 7.7. Recognition rates are low On the Calibration tab, increase the size of the Region of Interest (ROI) - it may be too small to capture plates with high confidence On the Calibration tab, try to reduce the Plate Width Min and increase the Plate Width Max Examine the video from the Camera on the Calibration tab: If all license plates are not fully visible, re-aim the camera so that the each camera’s field of view fully covers the capture zone. For a more precise adjustment, verify that the license plate’s images are as close to the middle of the video display as possible. If the images are spotted, remove dirt and dust from the front window of the camera with a soft cloth and mild soap Inex Technologies reserves the right to improve and enhance its product offerings.

Hardware (separate from the production system) is installed at target locations, and vehicle metrics of each transaction are logged. Production transaction data metrics such as axle count, automatic vehicle classification (AVC) class, and LPR are matched with RoadAudit transaction data. This can be done in real time, or during post-process. RoadAudit tools rapidly display mismatched transactions which are manually reviewed for disposition recording. Basic reports can be output in CSV format, and further analyzed by the client. RoadAudit can be moved from lane to lane or plaza to plaza, depending on audit needs. Higher quality reviews with significantly less human labor Not connected with existing production sensors, providing true independent results Eliminates contamination of data caused by other data logger audit tools that use production sensors Portability - enables more transactions and locations to be analyzed per audit period. Real-time continuous video evidence of all lane activity and toll metrics, with remote video playback Time-synchronized correlation of the in-lane production transaction data with the DVAS video stream Intuitive interface to query the system based on lane transaction ID, specific time and time range, lane or toll zone, vehicle license plate (full or partial) and vehicle classification Full reports of past transactions and associated video clips Multiple role-based authorization access for real-time video play or archived recordings - can be configured per time, lane ID or plaza The RoadAudit solution comes with independent, portable roadside equipment for recording and processing vehicle data. The system operates in a fully \"touchless\" way - no need for \"digging or cutting\" the road or building a new gantry infrastructure. The RoadAudit solution doesn’t require any integration with the production VES equipment. It works in parallel and independently from the production system, making the entire auditing process much more accurate and objective. RoadAudit roadside equipment includes: Item Illustration RoadView Video Camera for vehicle detection, axle counting and vehicle classification, and DVAS video streams RoadView ALPR All-in-one AI Camera System for license plate recognition (optional) RoadView external data processing server DVAS processing server RoadView Video Camera and RoadView ALPR camera illuminators Equipment mounting Hardware RoadAudit is designed to be easily installable and portable, and easy to operate. In most cases, the system can use existing production infrastructure such as road gantries, side poles or cantilevers. The cameras use 24 VDC; the entire system requires no more than 400W of power All communication between the cameras and servers is Ethernet-based.

Wiring Table Item Description Ordering Information A LAN Patch Cable - CAT6, max. length 3.3 ft (1 m) Supplied by integrator B LAN Cable - CAT6, shielded, 4 pairs, 22 AWG, max. length 328 ft (100 m), OD 5.5-7.9 mm Supplied by integrator; 6.6 ft (2 m) included with camera C PAS (Power and Signals) Cable - 22 AWG, OD 3.0-7.3 mm Supplied by integrator; 6.6 ft (2 m) cable included with camera D Power Supply - 48 VDC For 1 camera, use a 75 W supply (IZPWR75-48) For 2 cameras, use a 120 W supply (IZPWR120-48) For 4 cameras, use a 240 W supply (IZPWR240-48) E Gate Supplied by integrator F Inductive Loop Supplied by integrator G Loop Detector Supplied by integrator The factory default IP addresses of the onboard processor, LPR and OV cameras are on the unit’s sticker, typically: Processor (192.168.5.110), LPR (192.168.5.111) OV (192.168.5.112). If needed, use IZ Discovery to change to other consecutive network addresses you have allocated. The IZ Discovery utility discovers all active devices connected to the network, and displays a list of their network parameters. These devices can include cameras and computers. If any device on your network is connected via wireless, IZ Discovery will not recognize the device. In addition, if the computer running IZ Discovery is connected via wireless, you will not see any devices displayed. Download the IZ Discovery software (link) Run IZ Discovery When IZ Discovery first runs, you may see a Windows security warning. If so, click Run. If you see a message related to the Windows firewall, click Allow. IZ Discovery will start and display a list of devices on the network, according to their serial numbers (see Figure 4). Scroll down to find the device you are interested in. You can double-click to view/edit a specific device’s IP address parameters (see Section 6.2). Click Clear List to refresh the discovery process. Figure 4. IZ Discovery Utility If IZ Discovery does not recognize a device: Press the device’s reset button (if available) Reset the device by shutting off power/removing the LAN cable, waiting 5 seconds, and reapplying power Check the LAN cable between your laptop and the network, and the LAN cable between the device and the LAN switch. Replace the cable(s) and run IZ Discovery again. Figure 5. Changing the Device’s Network Settings It is highly recommended to use a fixed IP address (not DHCP). A fixed IP address enables you to access the computer using the same URL every time, even after unexpected power outages. A dynamic IP address may change upon device reboot. Before opening the web interface, you will have to find the current IP address of the device using IZ Discovery. If you want to copy the IP address (for login to the device) you will need to uncheck the DHCP checkbox momentarily to make the address field accessible. For devices using RoadView software, you can change the IP address using the RoadView Settings tab. If your device is an Inex Camera System, be sure to define IP addresses for each camera (LPR and Overview), using each camera’s configuration application. It is recommended to use sequential IP addresses for the Camera System and its cameras; for example: 192.168.5.110, 192.168.5.111, 192.168.5.112 To change the device’s mode (fixed or dynamic [DHCP]), or IP address: Select the relevant line in the list of devices and double-click on it. The Network Settings window appears To change the mode: Check or uncheck the DHCP box Click Save To change the IP address: Verify that the address is not used by any other device on the network Be sure to uncheck the DHCP box Enter the network address parameters Write down the new IP Address and click Save The change should be reflected in the main dialog. This can take about a minute until the IP is obtained. If you do not see the change after this time, close IZ Discovery, and then reopen it. Verify that the IP address parameters have been changed to the ones you wanted. If not, you will have to log into the device (or RoadView) and change the IP address. To view the camera’s home page (see Figure 6): Open a browser. Enter the IP address of the camera into the address field. Figure 6. Camera’s Home Page Select the function you need from the links at the upper left: Click the Live button to see what the camera is currently viewing. You can also use the zoom and focus controls. Click to show notes for Live View When using Live View for the first time, you may be prompted to download and install an ActiveX control (Smart Viewer). If you do not have an internet connection to the network on which the camera is installed, wait 30 seconds, and you will be instructed on how to install the ActiveX control locally via the camera’s firmware. The stream of the Live View can also be accessed using an RTSP URL with this format : rtsp://[username:password]@/cam0_0 where cam0_0 is a camera-specific parameter (which in this case enables you to access the primary stream) To see the stream, use a video player such as the VLC player, located at: VLC If you need to change the camera’s IP address or other configuration parameters, click the Admin button. When prompted for a login, use the Administrator username/password credentials of root, IZpass12. The Administrator user name (root) cannot be changed, and the Administrator password is encrypted. Therefore, if someone changes the Administrator password, there is no way to find out the password if it gets lost. The focus will be set automatically; can be fine-adjusted manually with buttons Use the buttons to Zoom in/out Enter username and password (root/IZpass12) Use the menu at the left to select the parameter category/sub-category/group. After changing settings, remember to click the Apply button at the bottom of each parameter section. The camera(s) are pre-configured; this section displays typical settings for reference. Figure 7. LPR Camera - Video & Device > Video Streams (Triggered Mode) For Non-triggered mode, set the primary stream frame rate to 10 fps. Figure 8. LPR Camera - Video & Device > Video Streams (Non-triggered Mode) Figure 9. LPR Camera - Video & Device > Video Streams > Camera Settings Figure 10. LPR Camera - Video & Device > Video Streams > Primary Stream Figure 11. LPR Camera - System > Access Level The camera(s) are pre-configured; this section displays typical settings for reference. Figure 12. OV Camera - Video & Device > Video Streams (Triggered Mode) For Non-triggered mode, set the primary stream frame rate to 10 fps. Figure 13. OV Camera - Video & Device > Video Streams (Non-triggered Mode) Figure 14. OV Camera - Video & Device > Video Streams > Camera Settings Figure 15. OV Camera - Video & Device > Video Streams > Primary Stream Figure 16. OV Camera - System > Access Level There are two cameras (sensors) in the Camera System. Both are calibrated in nearly the same way. The LPR camera is set to capture in black and white, and the Overview (OV) camera is set to capture in color. The OV camera can be used both to display an overview image, and to perform LPR recognition. You may even be able to improve read accuracy by changing the zoom to have one camera \"see\" closer than the other one. Move a vehicle next to, and at the middle of the capture line. (This is the position at which the vehicle detector signals that the vehicle is present.) Ensure that the Camera System is aimed at the middle of the lane, and is at the required capture distance. Alternatively, in a lab, position a license plate at the expected distance and height. Open a browser. Type in the IP address of the RoadView computer. For example: 192.168.5.110 You will see the login screen. Enter the default username and password (root, root): Figure 17. Logging In to RoadView You should see the RoadView Live (Journal) tab (see Section 15). Click on the multi-line menu icon at the upper right of the RoadView screen Select \"Logout\" Figure 18. Logout (Multi-line Menu) Use the Settings tab after the first installation or re-installation of the ALPR system, or when some fundamental parameters need updating. For example, if the Camera System was moved to a different location (time zone). Configure the parameters in the order in this section of the document. After clicking the Save button at the end of the Detector Configuration section, it will take several seconds before the Live tab can start displaying Events. Also, some defaults and/or available parameters may change, depending on the Detector Configuration \"Mode\" selected. The box at the upper right of the Settings screen shows: The RoadView software version (verify that the version is correct) The model, part number and serial number of the camera(s) RoadView is communicating with: Figure 19. Software Version and Camera Information Section Figure 20. Network Settings Section If needed, set the RoadView computer’s IP address parameters. Remember to click the Save button in this section; the change will be applied immediately. The Network Settings refer to the RoadView computer (Camera System) - NOT the computer on which the browser displaying the GUI is running. It is highly recommended to use a fixed IP address (not DHCP). A fixed IP address enables you to access the computer using the same URL every time, even after unexpected power outages. The Date and Time Settings refer to the location of the RoadView computer (Camera System) - NOT the computer on which the browser displaying the GUI is running. The Time Zone selections are organized by continent. For example, the \"America/\" prefix covers various cities and countries in North America (U.S. and Canada) and South America. Figure 21. Date and Time Settings Section Set Time (Automatically/Manually) - The preferred setting is \"Set Time Automatically\". If Automatic, the date and time will be updated from a central NTP (Network Time) server; the server can be in the cloud or on a local NTP server. (The default is ntp.ubuntu.com.) Enter the NTP server URL Select the interval at which you want RoadView to poll for the date and time (selected from the Polling Interval dropdown). Click the \"Update Now\" button to update the date and time immediately. The icon (green check mark or red \"x\") indicates if the URL of the NTP server is correct, and if the connection to it was successful. If an NTP server is not available, select Manual. Click in the Date and Time box to display a calendar/time popup. Select a Time Zone; set it to the local time at the location in which the Camera System/DPU is installed (not the UTC default). Remember to click the Save button at the end of this section after making changes. Use this section to add and configure Lanes. Figure 22. Lanes Section Actions: Edit - edit the Lane’s parameters Delete - delete the Lane (a warning will be displayed) Trigger - send a software trigger immediately to RoadView Each Lane number must be unique in the overall ALPR system. The images from all cameras capturing the same physical lane will be combined into a single Event. Each \"Lane\" is actually a virtual Lane. For example, if you have two Camera Systems capturing the same physical lane, you will need to create two different \"Lanes\", and associate each Camera System’s cameras with a different \"Lane\". Figure 23. Add/Edit Lane Dialog ID (required) - The identification number of the lane to be captured by the cameras. This number will appear associated with Events in the Live tab. Name (required) - The name of the Lane as it will appear throughout the user interface (GUI). Location - Select one of the following options: Unknown - the camera’s position relative to vehicles is unknown. Front - the camera in this Lane is capturing images from the front of vehicles Rear - the camera in this Lane is capturing images from the rear of vehicles Passageway - Unused Ignore Opposite Direction - Unused Figure 24. Cameras Section Actions: Edit - edit the camera’s parameters (see Figure 25) Delete - delete the camera (a warning will be displayed) Camera table headers: Camera ID, Lane ID, Name, URL, Type (as configured when the camera was added) Image - Thumbnail image from a recent camera image If you add a camera, or edit a camera’s parameters and click the Save button in this dialog (even if you did not change the URL), you may see a warning icon in the Image column. The reappearance of the image indicates that the core software has restarted, and Events will resume being captured and displayed in the Live tab, with the following changes: - The Transaction ID will continue to increase from the last Transaction ID. - The history of previous Events for that camera will be cleared Add Camera (button at end of Cameras section): Figure 25. Add/Edit Camera Dialog Lane ID - The identification number of the lane being captured by the camera(s). Select a Lane number you defined (see Section 12.4). This number will appear associated with Events in the Live tab. The images from all cameras capturing the same physical lane will be combined into a single Event. Using the same Lane ID for different cameras (even the LPR and OV cameras within the same Camera System) will combine the reads into one Event (see Section 12.4). You may even be able to improve read accuracy by changing the zoom to have one camera \"see\" closer than the other one. You could also position cameras to be in different positions (front/rear). Camera ID - For internal use; should be unique in the overall ALPR system Name - Camera name for internal use; should be unique in the overall ALPR system URL - HTTP URL: HTTP URL example: http:// Type - Type of camera (LPR or View) Trigger Pre - Set as shown Trigger Post - Set as shown The minimum TIBA SmartPark version required is 9.3.3 Enable TIBA Integration and set the parameters as follows. Remember to click the Save button at the end of the Detector Configuration section after making changes. Figure 26. TIBA Integration The required TIBA API token is hardcoded; it is not required to define it here. TIBA URL For TIBA Cloud, the URL of the TIBA server. For example: https://yoursite.sp.tibaparking.net/ DO NOT enter the addition for the full path (/LprData/LPR/LPRevent) For On Prem, the IP address of the SmartPark server and Services Hosting port as defined in the TIBA LPR settings. For example (see Figure 27): https://31.154.177.6:29811/ DO NOT enter any addition for a full path. Figure 27. TIBA LPR Settings User Name - BasicAuth username to access the TIBA server Password - BasicAuth password to access the TIBA server Camera Port - Not required, leave at default, for future expansion - the HTTPS port on which RoadView listens for capture and “open gate” commands Auth Key - Not required, for future expansion - the key that should be in one of the headers sent by the TIBA server, in the HTTP requests for capture and “open gate” commands Auth Value - Not required, for future expansion - the value for the header with the key defined by Auth Key, that should match the value sent by the TIBA server, in the HTTP requests for capture and “open gate” commands Send Plate Image - when enabled, if the Plate image is found and there was recognition, the Plate image is sent as part of the Event; if there was no recognition, the OV image is sent Send OV Image - when enabled, the OV image is always sent as part of the Event Lane ID - Not used, for future expansion - this table is automatically populated with the number of lanes defined in the Lanes section at the bottom of the Settings tab GPIO - Not used, leave at default (0) Set the Direct Trigger Mode as follows: For Front Capture - OnRise For Rear Capture - OnFall Remember to click the Save button at the end of the Detector Configuration section after making changes. Figure 28. Direct Trigger Section Set the Direct Trigger Mode to Disabled Remember to click the Save button at the end of the Detector Configuration section after making changes. Figure 29. Trigger Offset Section You can capture a vehicle (and create an Event) at a different position than the location of the in-ground loop. Use this Trigger Offset parameter to capture the vehicle before or after the loop. For example, in this illustration, the loop is directly under the barrier bar. Setting the Trigger Offset to -200 will move the capture point up the lane, and capture the plate before it is obstructed from view by the bar. Figure 30. Trigger Offset Illustration Enable Trigger Offset and set the parameter (in milliseconds) Remember to click the Save button at the end of the Detector Configuration section after making changes. Disable (uncheck) the \"Enabled\" checkbox. Remember to click the Save button at the end of the Detector Configuration section after making changes. Set the parameters as shown here Remember to click the Save button at the end of this section after changing these parameters. Figure 31. Detector Configuration Section Explanations of frequently used parameters: Mode - Note that parameters may appear or be hidden, depending on the chosen Mode. Triggered - Events are created and reported when a trigger is received NonTriggered - Events are created and reported by LPR video analytics Region - Region for which characters on the plate will be recognized. Select from the following options: Australia Canada/North America - same as North America LPR, with a different state recognition model that includes Canadian states. Europe Israel North America - general recognition that includes all U.S.A. states Saudi Arabia South Africa Taiwan United Arab Emirates Vietnam Include all images (for \"Triggered\" and \"NonTriggered With Trigger\" modes only) - Enables display in Live tab, and sending of all images (including pre- and post-trigger frames) - not only the \"best\" ones that were used for plate recognition Image Resize - when enabled, and the Event confidence is equal or higher than the Resize Confidence parameter, then each LPR and OV image is resized according to the Image Width (and the height is resized proportionally). Image Width - the resize width Resize Confidence - the Event confidence threshold for enabling resizing Set the parameters as shown here Remember to click the Save button at the end of this section after changing these parameters. Explanations of frequently used parameters: Night Mode Disable - White LEDs are OFF Enable - White LEDs are ON OV LED Intensity - Relative intensity of the built-in white LEDs, expressed as a percentage of the maximum possible intensity Illuminator Intensity - Unused Auto - White LEDs are ON at night, OFF during the day, according to the Camera System’s location (defined by the Latitude and Longitude parameters). Additional parameters are: Latitude and Longitude are user-entered coordinates; determine them using Google maps, by clicking on the location where the Camera System will be installed (remember to put in a minus sign as needed) Latitude - latitude coordinate of Camera System’s location Longitude - longitude coordinate of Camera System’s location Post-Sunrise Offset - time after actual sunrise to be considered as the start of the day Pre-Sunset Offset -time before actual sunset to be considered the end of the day Figure 32. Calibration Tab When you see a vehicle at a typical capture position on the video, click on the video to pause it. It is recommended to use the view called \"Draw image by maintaining aspect ratio (two-headed arrow)\". You select this view by clicking on the right-most button at the upper left of the screen: Select a camera from the dropdown list (LPR or OV). The Frame Width (horizontal) and Frame Height (vertical) are displayed at the lower left, and are set automatically. The Frame Timestamp at the lower left displays the date and time that the image is being taken/was taken by the camera. Aim the camera using the mounting bracket’s adjustment hardware (see Figure 33). Pan: Adjust the Pan so that the image of the license plate is in the horizontal middle of the Field of View. Tilt: Adjust the Tilt so that the image of every expected plate position (depending on the vehicle type, such as passenger cars, jeeps, trucks, etc.) will be in the middle of the screen (from top to bottom). Roll: Adjust the Roll so the license plate’s image is horizontally straight, parallel to the ground (not tilted to one side). Figure 33. Pan/Tilt/Roll (Angle) Adjustments When the correct position is achieved, make a preliminary tightening of the mounting screws. Define the Region of Interest (ROI) by dragging on the corners (vertices) of the trapezoidal region. For optimum recognition accuracy, the ROI should be large enough to capture the region where plates could be found in images. The following settings for the LPR and OV cameras are saved separately. For example, you may want a Region of Interest that is different for each camera. Use the zoom and focus buttons to adjust the view of the video until the width of the plate is withing the extent of the vertices, and its plate image is clear and sharp. (The surrounding items, such as the vehicle body, do not need to be as sharp as the plate.) There is a delay between a click of a zoom/focus button and when you see the effect on the screen. Be sure to wait until you see the change on the screen before clicking the button again. Clicking the button multiple times will cause you to \"overshoot\" the desired zoom/focus. As you adjust the zoom and focus, you may need to reposition the camera in order to get the image of the plate back to the desired position. Define the Plate Width Min: Events will only be created for plate reads whose width is greater than or equal to this parameter. Enter the desired value in the Plate Width Min text box. This parameter can also be configured by dragging the small circle on the horizontal line on the Calibration tab (expressed in pixels). This parameter can be used to ignore small plate reads. For example, if the image was taken when a vehicle is too far away, the characters are too small to be read - even by a human. Define the Plate Width Max: Events will only be created for plate reads whose width is less than or equal to this parameter. Enter the desired value in the Plate Width Max text box. This parameter can also be configured by dragging the large circle on the horizontal line on the Calibration tab (expressed in pixels). This parameter can be used to prevent false reads, such as large numbers on trucks. Direction (red arrow on video): Not used When you have finished, click the Save button. Wait several seconds for the display to refresh automatically, which indicates that the RoadView recognition software is running again with the updated parameters. When the correct position is achieved, make a final tightening of the mounting hardware. Repeat these steps for the other camera. Using a license plate mounted in a lab, or by driving a vehicle through the lane, verify that an Event is generated with the correct plate read, as recorded in the RoadView Live (Journal) tab. Figure 34. Live (Journal) Tab Once the lane is active, verify that Events are being generated for each vehicle passing each camera, and that the recognition has sufficient accuracy and confidence. You can use the Search tab to find Event records stored in the RoadView database. IZCloud ALPR Performance Monitoring software (IZCloud-APM) is an advanced SaaS (Software as a Service) application. You can: Monitor real-time Events seamlessly Quickly and accurately search for license plates Benefit from daily analytical reports, which provide insights into ALPR performance Log in to RoadView (see Section 11). On the Settings tab, enable IZCloud Integration and set the parameters as follows: Remember to click the Save button at the end of the Detector Configuration section after making changes. Figure 35.

RoadView Troubleshooting Symptom Possible Solution Thumbnails in Settings tab, in the Camera section at bottom have been replaced by red exclamation points and/or The Live tab and Search tab are empty (no Events are detected) Verify that each camera’s IP address in the Camera System, and the RoadView computer’s IP address are all on the same subnet. Verify that stable power at the correct level is being supplied to the cameras, even when under a heavy processing load. Verify that the IP address(es) configured in RoadView match the IP addresses that you configured in the camera(s). See Section 12.5. Recognition rates are low On the Calibration tab, increase the size of the Region of Interest (ROI) - it may be too small to capture plates with high confidence On the Calibration tab, try to reduce the Plate Width Min and increase the Plate Width Max Examine the video from the Camera on the Calibration tab: If all license plates are not fully visible, re-aim the Camera System so that the each camera’s field of view fully covers the capture zone. For a more precise adjustment, verify that the license plate’s images are as close to the middle of the video display as possible. If the images are spotted, remove dirt and dust from the front window of the Camera System with a soft cloth and mild soap If the images are not sharp, adjust the zoom and focus of each camera.

Traditional tolling falls short of the need for user-friendly, reliable and scalable toll collection. Inex’s advanced tolling system is a game-changer. Using high resolution cameras, AI-driven license plate recognition and a sophisticated billing system, Inex transforms roads into smart highways. The use of eWallets ensures swift seamless transactions, no matter how complex a customer’s journey through different tolling zones at different times. ALPR AI Cameras and Illuminators Comprehensive Video Analytics Integration with Existing Equipment AlphaV Billing System AlphaV eWallet /{TBD: picture(s)} The foundation of Inex’s toll road solution lies in its state-of-the-art ALPR (Advanced License Plate Recognition) cameras. These AI-powered cameras, together with dedicated illuminators, ensure real-time, clear capture of vehicles - even on high-speed open roads, day or night, under any weather conditions. /{TBD: picture(s)} Inex’s sophisticated algorithms not only capture basic plate details, but delve deeper by identifying: /{but isn’t this obvious? what else to mention - based on department of transporation registration records} Plate ID: vehicle identification State of Issue: State or region of the plate’s origin Vehicle Type: Such as commercial, private, government /{can we promise this?} Color /{can we promise this?} Make /{TBD: picture(s)} Your existing equipment can be seamlessly integrated with the Inex system, for example: RFID: Radio Frequency Identification is supported, adding to the user’s options for contactless toll payments. Gate Control: Inex’s solution manages gate control mechanisms, ensuring unimpeded vehicle flow while upholding security standards. /{TBD: picture(s)} Inex’s innovative AlphaV Billing System encompasses: Open Billing: For toll roads where a fixed amount of is paid, regardless of where the vehicle enters/exits or the distance travelled Closed Billing: Charges are determined based on entry and exit points of vehicles on specific road segments, according to the distance travelled Dynamic Road Pricing: Tailors toll fees based on variables such as vehicle type, time of day, congestion, and other relevant factors. This dynamic approach not only optimizes revenue but can also potentially reduce peak-time congestion. Multiple Payment Sources: Bank, credit card, eWallet /{TBD: picture(s)} The Inex eWallet app isn’t just about making payments - it’s a complete digital bank account tailored for convenience. Its outstanding feature is streamlining open road tolling. Imagine driving without the need for stops or searching for change; the eWallet handles tolls effortlessly. But there’s so much more to offer…​ Beyond basic transactions, eWallet gives users more value for their money. They can earn cashback and rewards, turning everyday payments into savings opportunities. Plus, for those who appreciate a good deal, the app showcases special ads and tailored promotions. Whether it’s discounts at a favorite store, cashback on tolls, or exclusive offers, the Inex eWallet becomes a one-stop digital hub for transactions, savings, and exciting rewards. /{I didn’t know we had a project in Virginia; are you sure that you didn’t mean Louisiana?} Inex: One of INEX’s outstanding achievements is its proven experience in handling USA projects, known for their technically challenging requirements. The USA’s diverse range of vehicles, vast network of roads, and stringent regulations demand advanced AI technology for accurate toll collection. Inex’s ability to thrive in such an environment attests to its technical robustness and adaptability. Competitors: Even though some competitors have ventured into the USA market, few have successfully navigated its intricacies and technical challenges with the same success as Inex. Inex: With a solid 20-year tenure in the tolling industry, Inex has adapted to the evolution of technology and challenges, positioning itself as a trusted and reliable solution provider. Competitors: Few competitors can match the Inex’s legacy and experience, which can lead to potential gaps in understanding the nuances of diverse markets or specific regional challenges. Inex: Inex stands out with its unique combination of an advanced billing system and a dynamic eWallet app, demonstrating its commitment to a superior user experience. The billing system smoothly integrates with various payment platforms and banks. The eWallet goes beyond the norm, functioning as a user’s digital bank account, complete with cashback opportunities, rewards, and tailored promotions. This duo guarantees every transaction is not just seamless, but also provides benefit to the user. Competitors: Without the eWallet component, competitors are missing out on the convenience and added value that Inex offers to its users.
