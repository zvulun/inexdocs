= INEX Documents Playbook Repository

== INEX Documents
This is the repository holding the antora-playbook.yml file project for publishing INEX documentation using Asciidoc and Antora.
The repository also holds:

- The .gitignore file, which designates which folders and file extensions and specific files to be ignored when pushing the local repo to the remote repo
- The node_modules folder (which is set to be ignored); contains the node.js files used to run the Java code that Antora uses
- A couple of json files Antora uses - package-lock and package
- The build folder (which is set to be ignored; where the local output of the site will be stored so you can view it)
- The README.adoc file for the overall project
