= INEX Documents Playbook Repository

== INEX Documents
This is the repository holding the antora-playbook.yml file project for publishing INEX documentation using Asciidoc and Antora. A playbook file defines what content is included in your site, what user interface (UI) is applied to it, and where the site is published.

The repository also holds:

- The .gitignore file, which designates which folders and file extensions and specific files to be ignored when pushing the local repo to the remote repo
- A couple of json files Antora uses - package-lock and package
- This README.adoc file

Folders in the local version of the repository which are not pushed to GitHub are:

- The node_modules folder (which is set to be ignored); contains the node.js files used to run the Java code that Antora uses
- The build folder (which optionally can be set to be ignored when doing a lot of edits; where the local output of the site will be stored so you can view it)
